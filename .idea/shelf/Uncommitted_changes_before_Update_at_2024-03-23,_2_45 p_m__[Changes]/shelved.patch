The holidays are over, the snow has overstayed its welcome, and although spring is just around the corner, you still have to endure a few more weeks of ice-cold mornings scraping your car and shoveling snow. We’re here to help! Here are 5 ways you can beat the winter blues. GEAR UP No one will get excited about the weather if they’re not dressed for it, so make sure you have proper attire. Get yourself a warm pair of boots that are also waterproof. Fuzzy, cozy footwear is great until the snow seeps through and hits your feet. Once your socks are wet and cold, there’s little you can do to warm back up. Wearing mittens instead of gloves can make a big difference. With mitts, your fingers stay together, generating more body heat. Whereas gloves might allow you to be more dexterous, your hands will be warmer in mittens. Invest in a good coat, ideally, one that’s long enough to cover some of your legs and not just your torso. EAT YOUR VITAMIN D Vitamin D is important year-round, but it’s more challenging to get the recommended dose when the sun is only out for a few hours a day. To get your fix of vitamin D, try eating foods like salmon, canned tuna, vitamin D-fortified milk, and egg yolks. FIND AN ACTIVITY THAT YOU CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT The cold weather will be more enjoyable if you have a hobby. Instead of waiting for the snow to melt, embrace the cold for the unique opportunities it provides. Try snowshoeing, skating, skiing or snowboarding. If you'd rather be indoors, try hitting the gym. The benefits that regular exercise has on physical health are well-known and widely discussed but there are also incredible mental health benefits that working out offers. Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress and increase positive self-esteem, mood, and energy! START YOUR DAY EARLY When it’s cold out, you’re more tempted to snooze your alarm and stay under the blankets for as long as possible. But getting an early start to your day can help improve your mood and mental clarity. Wake up early, slow down and relax. Take the extra time to enjoy your breakfast and a cup of coffee instead of scrambling to get a bite on your way out the door. Better yet, try an early morning workout to get your day started before work or school. If you find it hard to motivate yourself early in the morning, pop into a Group Fitness Class and let the pros handle it! GET SOCIAL Everything is better with friends. When all else fails, and you just want to curl up with a cup of hot chocolate and stay indoors, go for it! But before you do, call up a friend and see if they want to come binge-watch Netflix or try some new recipes. Even though it’s cold out, it’s still important to socialize and catch up with friends and family. 5 façons de combattre la déprime hivernale Parce qu’il reste encore quelques semaines avant le printemps ! Presque partout au Canada, le mois de février est le mois le plus froid de l’année. La période des fêtes est terminée, la neige persiste, et même si le printemps se pointe le nez, il nous faudra endurer encore pendant quelques semaines des matins glacés à dégivrer la voiture et à pelleter l’entrée. Nous sommes ici pour vous aider ! Voici cinq façons de combattre la déprime hivernale. HABILLEZ-VOUS BIEN CHAUDEMENT! Personne ne s’emballera pour la saison d’hiver s’il ou elle n’est pas habillé∙e pour affronter le froid, alors assurez-vous d’avoir les bons vêtements ! Procurez-vous une bonne paire de bottes chaudes qui sont aussi imperméables. Les chaussures en peluche sont douillettes et confortables jusqu’à ce que la neige et la gadoue s’infiltrent et atteignent vos pieds ! Une fois vos chaussettes mouillées et froides, il n’y a plus rien à faire pour réchauffer vos pieds. Porter des mitaines plutôt que des gants peut faire une différence importante. Dans une mitaine, vos doigts restent ensemble, se réchauffant les uns les autres. Bien que les gants vous permettent une plus grande dextérité, vos doigts, isolés, gèleront plus rapidement. Investissez dans un bon manteau, idéalement assez long pour couvrir une partie de vos jambes, pas seulement le haut du corps. PRENEZ DE LA VITAMINE D Bien qu’un apport en vitamine D soit important tout au long de l’année, obtenir la bonne quantité est un défi lorsque les heures d’ensoleillement sont plus courtes en saison froide. Pour avoir la bonne dose de vitamine D, mangez des aliments tels le saumon, le thon en conserve, le lait enrichi de vitamine D, et les jaunes d’œufs. TROUVEZ UNE ACTIVITÉ QUI VOUS EMBALLERA Les températures froides seront plus plaisantes si vous avez un passe-temps. Plutôt que d’attendre impatiemment que la neige fonde, célébrez le froid pour les possibilités qu’elle recèle. Essayez la raquette, le patin, le ski, ou même la planche à neige ! Si vous êtes davantage du type casanier, allez au gym ! Les bienfaits qu’entraine l’exercice régulier sur la santé physique sont bien connus et font l’objet de bien des discussions, mais, d’incroyables bienfaits sur la santé mentale découlent également de l’entrainement physique. D’ailleurs, il a été démontré que l’exercice aérobique contribue à réduire l’anxiété, la dépression et le stress, et à augmenter l’estime de soi, l’humeur, et l’énergie ! COMMENCEZ VOTRE JOURNÉE PLUS TÔT Quand il fait froid dehors, vous êtes davantage tenté de retarder votre réveil et de rester sous les couvertures aussi longtemps que possible. Mais débuter la journée tôt peut contribuer à améliorer votre humeur et votre clarté mentale. Réveillez-vous tôt, ralentissez, et détendez-vous. Prenez ce temps pour savourer un bon petit-déjeuner et boire un bon café plutôt que de vous précipiter à l’extérieur avec une rôtie froide, vos mitaines, et votre café à emporter dans les mains. Encore mieux, essayez un entrainement matinal pour débuter votre journée de travail ou d’études. Si la motivation ne vous vient pas facilement si tôt le matin, joignez-vous à un cours de groupe et laissez un pro s’en occuper ! SOCIALISEZ Tout est toujours mieux quand on est en bonne compagnie. Quand tout a échoué, et que tout ce dont vous rêvez est de vous installer confortablement avec une tasse de chocolat chaud dans votre fauteuil préféré, faites-le ! Mais avant, appelez et invitez un∙e ami∙e pour écouter une série Netflix en rafale, ou pour essayer de nouvelles recettes. Même s’il fait froid dehors, il n’en demeure pas moins qu’il est important de socialiser et de prendre du temps avec des amis et la famille. Was this article helpful?

Few people can resist the caffeinated goodness, plus it offers what seems like endless delicious beverage options. If ‘treat yo self’ is your motto you’ve probably made a trip to the 'bucks here and there. Although delicious, ordering a frap with extra whipped cream and some chocolate drizzle isn’t the healthiest option. Calories and sugar content can really add up, and it’s important to try not to drink your calories. Here are some hacks to make your next trip to Starbucks a little healthier… but still delicious: Order a smaller size If you order a smaller size, you’re saving calories while still getting your Starbucks fix. While it might not seem like a lot to take a 20-ounce Venti order down to a 16-ounce Grande, you’re getting less of everything — calories, fat, and sugar. Choose your milk wisely Starbucks offers a variety of milks – including almond milk, soy milk and coconut milk. Different types of milk have different benefits, calorie contents, etc. Check out this chart for a breakdown of different options. Typically, when you order a drink that contains milk, Starbucks uses 2 percent, unless you specify otherwise. So if you want your drink made dairy-free, with whole milk, with non-fat milk or something else, make sure you say so! Skip the whipped cream Added toppings mean added calories. Whipped cream can add at least 50 calories to your drink. For example, a Grande nonfat Caffè Mocha can go from 290 calories to 360 when whipped cream is added. If you’re adding whipped topping, you can also expect to consume a lot more fat (15g versus the 8g with no whipped cream) as well. Order light or skinny Starbucks also offers ‘skinny’ or ‘light’ options. Skinny options are made with nonfat milk, sugar-free syrup and no whipped cream. Light drinks usually come with nonfat milk, light syrup, and ice for fewer calories. Opt for unsweetened If you want to make a healthy change, avoid the sweeteners altogether. Syrups skyrocket sugar and calorie content. Consuming these sweet syrups also can trigger sweets cravings, causing you to eat/drink even more sugar! Get back to basics When in doubt, go back to the basics – coffee, tea, espresso and cappuccino are the best options when treating yourself to a caffeinated beverage. If you’re trying to make your caffeine fix a little bit healthier, just say no to the high-in-calories, high-in-sugar Frappuccino. Was this article helpful?

Wash the vegetables and cut them into long spears (so they don't fall through the grates on the barbecue). Drizzle the veggies with avocado oil and season them with sea salt and pepper to taste. Grill the veggies on one side until they become slightly charred. Turn once and grill the other side quickly to preserve some crunch in the vegetables (about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on size of vegetables and power of grill). Remove the charred vegetables from the barbecue, chop them into bite-size pieces and set aside. Crumble the goat cheese and have it standing by. Rip the pea shoots into thirds by hand and set them aside as well. To make the vinaigrette, combine the juice of the grilled lemon, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, minced ginger, chili flakes, xylitol sweetener, apple cider vinegar, olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk vigorously to incorporate all ingredients into a creamy emulsified dressing. Place the arugula on a platter and top with the chopped and charred vegetables. Drizzle the dressing all over and finish with the crumbled goat cheese and the fresh pea shoots. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low, cover with lid, and cook for 15 minutes. When done, remove lid, fluff with a fork and let cool. Beets: Place washed beets in the centre of some aluminum foil, and wrap them up quite tightly. Place package in a preheated 350° oven for 60-90 minutes depending on size. Beets should be soft enough to poke with a knife when cooked. When done, let cool slightly, then trim off the top and bottom of each beet, then the skin should slide right off. Cut each peeled beet into 8 pieces and transfer to a bowl. Roasted garlic: Lay out another piece of aluminum foil, trim the bottom 1 cm off of a bulb of garlic, and then place on foil cut side up. Sprinkle with sea salt, and drizzle with 1/4 teaspoon avocado oil. Wrap up tightly and place into a preheated 350° oven for 45 minutes. When done, remove from oven, and squeeze garlic bulb to remove roasted garlic cloves. Broccoli and peppers: Chop peppers into large chunks and transfer to a bowl. Chop jalapeño into a small dice, and add to the same bowl. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon avocado oil, and season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly, then transfer to one side of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Next chop the broccoli into small florettes and place into a bowl. Drizzle with the other tablespoon of avocado oil, and season with sea salt and pepper. Mix well, then transfer to the other side of the parchment lined baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350° for 15 to 20 minutes or until broccoli is cooked to the level you want it. Roasted garlic tahini dressing: Place all dressing ingredients into a small blender and purée until smooth, transfer to a squeeze bottle. Put it all together: Divide the cooked quinoa into 3 containers. Add 1/3 of the cooked and chopped beets, 1/3 of the roasted peppers and 1/3 of the roasted broccoli to each container. Top each portion with approx. 2 tbsp of the dressing and 1/3 of the micro greens. Recipe will last 4-5 days in the fridge. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

Few people can resist the caffeinated goodness, plus it offers what seems like endless delicious beverage options. If ‘treat yo self’ is your motto you’ve probably made a trip to the 'bucks here and there. Although delicious, ordering a frap with extra whipped cream and some chocolate drizzle isn’t the healthiest option. Calories and sugar content can really add up, and it’s important to try not to drink your calories. Here are some hacks to make your next trip to Starbucks a little healthier… but still delicious: Order a smaller size If you order a smaller size, you’re saving calories while still getting your Starbucks fix. While it might not seem like a lot to take a 20-ounce Venti order down to a 16-ounce Grande, you’re getting less of everything — calories, fat, and sugar. Choose your milk wisely Starbucks offers a variety of milks – including almond milk, soy milk and coconut milk. Different types of milk have different benefits, calorie contents, etc. Check out this chart for a breakdown of different options. Typically, when you order a drink that contains milk, Starbucks uses 2 percent, unless you specify otherwise. So if you want your drink made dairy-free, with whole milk, with non-fat milk or something else, make sure you say so! Skip the whipped cream Added toppings mean added calories. Whipped cream can add at least 50 calories to your drink. For example, a Grande nonfat Caffè Mocha can go from 290 calories to 360 when whipped cream is added. If you’re adding whipped topping, you can also expect to consume a lot more fat (15g versus the 8g with no whipped cream) as well. Order light or skinny Starbucks also offers ‘skinny’ or ‘light’ options. Skinny options are made with nonfat milk, sugar-free syrup and no whipped cream. Light drinks usually come with nonfat milk, light syrup, and ice for fewer calories. Opt for unsweetened If you want to make a healthy change, avoid the sweeteners altogether. Syrups skyrocket sugar and calorie content. Consuming these sweet syrups also can trigger sweets cravings, causing you to eat/drink even more sugar! Get back to basics When in doubt, go back to the basics – coffee, tea, espresso and cappuccino are the best options when treating yourself to a caffeinated beverage. If you’re trying to make your caffeine fix a little bit healthier, just say no to the high-in-calories, high-in-sugar Frappuccino. Was this article helpful?

Research shows older adults are the most vulnerable to falls (63%), but half of adolescents and 35 per cent of working-age adults have suffered a fall over a one-year period. There are steps we can take to build up our strength and stability, balance and flexibility to reduce the risk of falls, twists and tears. It's called ‘prehabilitation’ and it's an approach to avoid injuries, and recover more effectively when you DO hurt yourself. What is prehabilitation? Prehab exercises build ‘functional fitness’ which is the ability to perform life’s daily activities (both required and recreational) with the required strength, stamina and suppleness to keep you moving the way you need to. Performing functional exercises regularly (as part of an exercise routine) can not only make you more resistant to injury but can also help correct or lessen the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and ideally keep you out of the rehabilitation phase. Prehabilitation exercises can: Improve posture and correct movement patterns Equalize imbalances in muscle length, joint alignment and flexibility Improve core stability (upper, lower and left vs right) Boost muscle strength, endurance and power Connect your mind with muscle movements and joint stability Try building these 5 prehab exercises into your workout regularly to help prevent injuries: Abdominal brace: Consistent core stability helps support the lower back, stabilize your pelvis (aka hips), improves balance and can help you catch yourself BEFORE you fall. Hip hinge: This move requires you to bend at the hip while keeping your spine and neck in alignment. This is a great move for building hip and core strength to support the lower back. Single leg squat: This move builds leg and hip strength, stability and balance for day-to-day activities such as walking, jogging, climbing, bending over to pick things up (gardening, cleaning, golfing). Single leg hip bridge: Strong glutes help support the lower back and can improve alignment from the hips to the ankles. Plank/Hover: This exercise builds overall core (abdominals, back, shoulder girdle and hip) muscles, for greater strength, stability and endurance. Not only that, but this move will help boost confidence that in the case of a fall, your mind and body will remember how to ‘break your fall’ and ‘brace’ against impact forces.

Often we experience back pain because the muscles that support our back need strengthening and stretching. According to research, exercise also increases blood flow to the lower back area, which can help reduce stiffness and speed up the healing process. Add this workout into your routine 2-3 times per week to help relieve your pain. HIP FLEXOR WALL STRETCH - 3 SETS AND HOLD FOR 30 SECONDS Begin by kneeling down and place your left knee on a yoga mat with your toes against the wall Place your right foot on the ground in front of you and lower your hips until you feel a stretch in the front of your left hip Make sure your right knee is directly above your ankle and place your hands on your front knee to help keep your torso straight Hold this position for the designated time and then slowly release and repeat on the opposite side REVERSE AB CURLS - 3 SETS OF 10 REPS Begin lying on a mat and extend your legs up with your knees bent As you exhale, contract your lower abs to push your feet into the air, lifting your hips slightly off the mat Return your hips and lower back to the mat with control, using your abdominals to create the movement for one rep Avoid using momentum to complete the movement and rolling on to your neck GLUTE HIP THRUSTS - 3 SETS OF 10 REPS Begin by positioning yourself in front of a bench, bending your knees so your feet are planted on the ground and hold a barbell on your hips (optional) Lean back so your shoulders are on the bench Drive hips up until your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle and your shoulders are at the top of the bench, with your body forming a straight line Pause at the top of the movement and squeeze your glutes Slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position for one rep ISOMETRIC BANDED HAMSTRING CURLS - 3 SETS OF 10 REPS Begin by fastening a resistance band to a sturdy object like a bar or bench Lie down on your stomach with your feet hip-width apart and place the band around one heel and flex your ankle Bend the knee to pull your heel toward your butt, keeping your thighs and hips on the mat Stop when you can’t pull any further and slowly return to the starting position for one rep Complete all reps on one leg before moving on to the opposite leg Was this article helpful?

Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, barbecue or grill pan, knife, cutting board, mixing bowls and tongs Instructions Preheat the barbecue or grill pan to high heat. Wash the vegetables and cut them into long spears (so they don't fall through the grates on the barbecue). Drizzle the veggies with avocado oil and season them with sea salt and pepper to taste. Grill the veggies on one side until they become slightly charred. Turn once and grill the other side quickly to preserve some crunch in the vegetables (about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on size of vegetables and power of grill). Remove the charred vegetables from the barbecue, chop them into bite-size pieces and set aside. Crumble the goat cheese and have it standing by. Rip the pea shoots into thirds by hand and set them aside as well. To make the vinaigrette, combine the juice of the grilled lemon, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, minced ginger, chili flakes, xylitol sweetener, apple cider vinegar, olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk vigorously to incorporate all ingredients into a creamy emulsified dressing. Place the arugula on a platter and top with the chopped and charred vegetables. Drizzle the dressing all over and finish with the crumbled goat cheese and the fresh pea shoots. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

But there are common mistakes many of us make that can set us back and affect our results and our enjoyment of these workouts. Here are the 6 most common workout mistakes, and how to fix them. 1. Skipping warmups Although it may save time, dodging the pre-workout warmup means your muscles are cold, your joints are stiff and your mindset isn’t ready. Not warming up puts you at risk of injury. The Fix: Design a regular warmup with bodyweight exercises like lunges, squats, pushups, and jumping jacks to elevate your heart rate before you move to weight training. 2. Not planning your routine Starting your workout without a plan is like grocery shopping without a list. You’ll end up wandering from machine to machine, or worse, looking at your phone, spending way more time than necessary. The Fix: Plan your workout in advance. Include the exercises, sets and reps, as well as the order you want to do them in so you can plan your route around the strength training area. 3. Doing the same workout every day The more you follow the same routine, the more your body builds a tolerance to it. As your workout gets easier, your body doesn‘t require as much energy to do it, which means you’re not burning as many calories and improving your fitness. The body adapts to an exercise after it has done it six workouts in a row. The Fix: Add intervals to your cardio routine. For example, do 30 seconds to a minute or more at a high intensity, followed by the same amount of time at an easier pace. For strength training, do each exercise in your routine for time rather than reps. Switch up the order of exercises, or add new ones. Try transitioning between exercises more quickly, with minimal rest time. 4. Focusing on force over form Many people push themselves too hard and add more reps to their programs thinking it will help them achieve results sooner. But neglecting form can have the opposite effect, causing you to use the wrong muscles, slowing progress and inviting injury. The same is true of functional exercises, where body form is everything. The Fix: Ask a fitness professional to demonstrate the exercises, emphasizing common pitfalls and things to check when you’re doing the move. For strength training, it’s a good idea to start with compound exercises like squats, deadlifts or pressing movements before working on smaller isolation exercises like bicep curls. Always have a workout buddy to “spot” you so you can maintain proper form. If you’re alone, start with the heavier weight, then when your form starts to fail, go down a level to a lighter weight. 5. Taking on too much too soon It can be tempting to jump into a high intensity routine, or lift too much too quickly, without building up to the task. While it looks good at first and you feel invincible, it’s asking for trouble when it comes to injury, exhaustion and sore muscles. The Fix: If you’re ready for a more aggressive program, have a qualified trainer or coach do an assessment on you first, then start on a progressive program that begins at your current fitness level. If you want to join a group workout, tell the instructor that you are new and have them offer you modifications for any exercises you may have trouble with. 6. Over training The ideal length of a workout is 45 to 60 minutes. After 60 minutes the body produces catabolic hormones (that break down muscles), and the nervous system is taxed. Over training is usually related to inadequate recovery -- meaning poor nutrition, sleep and stress levels. The Fix: Allow time for proper recovery and you don’t need to worry as much about overtraining. Depending on the workout, full recovery can take one to three days. When you go back to your routine, you should notice an improvement in your strength and energy levels. It seems simple, but a few small changes can make a big impact in the quality of your workout, and leave you feeing healthier and stronger. Was this article helpful?

Research shows older adults are the most vulnerable to falls (63%), but half of adolescents and 35 per cent of working-age adults have suffered a fall over a one-year period. There are steps we can take to build up our strength and stability, balance and flexibility to reduce the risk of falls, twists and tears. It's called ‘prehabilitation’ and it's an approach to avoid injuries, and recover more effectively when you DO hurt yourself. What is prehabilitation? Prehab exercises build ‘functional fitness’ which is the ability to perform life’s daily activities (both required and recreational) with the required strength, stamina and suppleness to keep you moving the way you need to. Performing functional exercises regularly (as part of an exercise routine) can not only make you more resistant to injury but can also help correct or lessen the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and ideally keep you out of the rehabilitation phase. Prehabilitation exercises can: Improve posture and correct movement patterns Equalize imbalances in muscle length, joint alignment and flexibility Improve core stability (upper, lower and left vs right) Boost muscle strength, endurance and power Connect your mind with muscle movements and joint stability Try building these 5 prehab exercises into your workout regularly to help prevent injuries: Abdominal brace: Consistent core stability helps support the lower back, stabilize your pelvis (aka hips), improves balance and can help you catch yourself BEFORE you fall. Hip hinge: This move requires you to bend at the hip while keeping your spine and neck in alignment. This is a great move for building hip and core strength to support the lower back. Single leg squat: This move builds leg and hip strength, stability and balance for day-to-day activities such as walking, jogging, climbing, bending over to pick things up (gardening, cleaning, golfing). Single leg hip bridge: Strong glutes help support the lower back and can improve alignment from the hips to the ankles. Plank/Hover: This exercise builds overall core (abdominals, back, shoulder girdle and hip) muscles, for greater strength, stability and endurance. Not only that, but this move will help boost confidence that in the case of a fall, your mind and body will remember how to ‘break your fall’ and ‘brace’ against impact forces.

Colley, Karen C. Roberts, Jean-Philippe Chaput and Wendy Thompson Release date: March 16, 2022 More information PDF version DOI: https://www.doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202200300001-eng On this page Abstract What is already known on this subject? What does this study add? Introduction Data and methods Measures Results Discussion Strengths Limitations References Abstract Background The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults, released in October 2020, recommend 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep for adults aged 18 to 64 and 7 to 8 hours for adults aged 65 and older, on a regular basis, with consistent sleep and wake times for health benefits. This study assesses the sleep behaviours of Canadian adults and how these behaviours align with the recommendations. Data and methods This cross-sectional study uses nationally representative data from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey healthy living rapid response module (N = 9,248), collected from January to March 2020. Sleep behaviours were self-reported by respondents, and descriptive statistics were used to calculate means or percentages for sleep duration, guideline adherence, physical activity and screen time, sleep timing, and sleep variability in the full sample. This was done by age, sex, household education, household income adequacy and employment status. Results Mean sleep duration was 7.9 hours for adults aged 18 to 64, with 77% meeting sleep duration recommendations, and 8.1 hours for adults aged 65 and older, with 55% meeting sleep duration recommendations. Among adults aged 18 to 64, 61% reported high sleep quality, compared with 71% among adults aged 65 and older. High sleep variability (≥30-minute difference between work and free days) and poor sleep-facilitating behaviours were prevalent. Adults who reported high sleep quality and high sleep variability were more likely to meet sleep duration recommendations. Interpretation To maximize health benefits, continued efforts are needed to promote good sleep behaviours among Canadian adults. Device-based measures of sleep could improve surveillance and research.

What is already known on this subject? Good sleep habits, which include adequate sleep duration, good sleep quality and sleep consistency, are associated with positive short-term and long-term health benefits. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines recommend that adults aged 18 to 64 obtain 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep on a regular basis, with consistent sleep and wake times for health benefits. The sleep duration recommendation for adults aged 65 and older is 7 to 8 hours of sleep. What does this study add? Three-quarters of Canadian adults aged 18 to 64 and half of Canadian adults aged 65 and older meet sleep duration recommendations. Two-thirds of Canadian adults report high sleep quality. Two-thirds of Canadian adults report high variability in sleep duration and wake-up time between work and free days. Two-thirds of Canadian adults use electronic devices within 30 minutes of falling asleep. High sleep quality and high sleep variability between work and free days are associated with meeting sleep duration recommendations. Introduction Sleep is a necessary part of daily life, with both short- and long-term health consequences. Sleep impacts physiological processes, cognitive performance and mood.Note 1 Good sleep behaviours are associated with reduced risk of adverse health conditions, including mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental and cognitive disorders, accidents, and injuries.Note 2 Sleep duration, quality, variability and timing are each components of sleep health that have been linked with health outcomes.Note 3 The relationship between sleep duration and both physical and mental health has been widely researched and is regarded as a U-shaped association.Note 2 Among adults, 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night have been most favourably associated with positive health outcomes,Note 2 whereas shorter and longer sleep durations have been associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes.Note 2Note 4 Sleep quality refers to efficiency in going to sleep and staying asleep, and also contributes to physical and mental health.Note 5 Variability in sleep timing between work and free days, and late sleep timing within the 24-hour day have been associated with adverse outcomes.Note 6 These behaviours can be affected by practices that facilitate sleep (often referred to as sleep hygiene),Note 7 including minimal electronic use before bed, minimal screen time and sufficient physical activity, among others.Note 8 October 2020 marked the release of the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Adults aged 18 to 64 years, and 65 years and older, including the first official sleep recommendations for Canadian adults. These guidelines were developed by a consensus panel, including national organizations (Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, Queen’s University and ParticipACTION), content experts, methodologists, stakeholders and end users. Further details are provided elsewhere.Note 9 The guidelines recommend 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep for adults aged 18 to 64, on a regular basis, with consistent sleep and wake times for health benefits. The recommendation for adults aged 65 and older is 7 to 8 hours of sleep.Note 9 These sleep recommendations are consistent with those of the National Sleep FoundationNote 1 and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.Note 10 The most recent nationally representative sleep data are from the 2014-to-2015 Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). Adults reported an average sleep duration of 7.2 hours, with 25% reporting trouble going to sleep or staying asleep most or all of the time.Note 11 Prior data are from the 2007-to-2013 CHMS.Note 12 Among adults aged 18 to 64, 65% slept between 7 and 9 hours per night, with an average duration of 7.1 hours, while 54% of adults aged 65 to 79 slept between 7 and 8 hours per night, with an average duration of 7.2 hours. Half of respondents reported trouble going to sleep or staying asleep sometimes, most of the time or all the time. This study provides an update on the sleep behaviours (duration, quality, work and free day variability, and timing) of Canadian adults and how they align with recommendations from the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines. It also examines the proportion of adults meeting sleep duration recommendations based on sociodemographic characteristics, sleep behaviours, physical activity and screen time. Data are from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) healthy living rapid response module, which are the most recent nationally representative sleep data for Canadian adults. Data and methods Data source This study uses data from the 2020 CCHS, a cross-sectional and nationally representative survey. The CCHS covers Canadians aged 12 years and older, excluding people living on First Nations reserves and other Indigenous settlements, full-time members of the Canadian Forces, the institutionalized population, foster children, and people living in the health regions Région du Nunavik and Région des Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James. The 2020 CCHS included a healthy living rapid response module, funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada, to obtain reliable national estimates on sleep. This module excluded respondents living in the three territories and proxy respondents. Data were collected by electronic questionnaire with computer-assisted interviewing, either over the phone or in person. Data collection occurred between January and March 2020, and was halted because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sample size and response rate Of 23,811 households sampled for the 2020 CCHS within the provinces between January and March, 13,654 (57.0%) agreed to participate. Responses were obtained from 11,432 individuals (individual response rate: 48.0%). From the 10,517 individuals aged 18 and older who were eligible for the healthy living rapid response module, 9,248 were included in analyses. Excluded individuals had incomplete, missing or invalid sleep data (n = 1,135) or were missing physical activity data (n = 134). Measures Sleep duration Participants were asked “In the past 7 days, what time did you usually fall asleep?” and “In the past 7 days, what time did you usually wake up?” on both “the days you worked / went to school” and “your days off / weekends.”Note 13 The full module can be accessed at Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Rapid Response - Healthy Living. Sleep duration was calculated as a weighted average of the time between sleep onset and waking up on work or school days (assumed 5 days per week) and free days (assumed 2 days per week). Extreme outliers (<3 hours or >16 hours of sleep) were corrected if there was a clear error in reporting a.m. as p.m. or vice versa, and excluded otherwise. Outliers for 351 individuals were corrected, while 359 were excluded. Sleep duration recommendation adherence As recommended by Ross et al. for national surveillance,Note 9 participants were classified as meeting the sleep recommendations of the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines if their sleep duration was between 7 hours, 0 minutes and 9 hours, 59 minutes for those aged 18 to 64, and between 7 hours, 0 minutes and 8 hours, 59 minutes for those aged 65 and older. Sleep quality Participants rated their overall sleep quality in the past 7 days as “excellent,” “good,” “fair,” or “poor.”Note 13 “Excellent” and “good” were classified as good-quality sleep, whereas “fair” and “poor” were classified as poor-quality sleep. Work and free day sleep variability Sleep duration variability was defined as a ≥30-minute difference in sleep duration between work or school days and free days (or weekdays and weekends if not working). Wake time variability was defined as a ≥30-minute difference in wake time between work and free days. Variability in sleep onset time was defined as a ≥30-minute difference in sleep time between work and free days. The 30-minute threshold was selected based on the distribution of data and other studies,Note 14 although other cutoffs (e.g., 1 hour) have also been used.Note 15 Sleep onset timing Sleep onset timing was calculated as a weighted average of the sleep onset time on work or school days and free days. Participants were classified as having a moderate sleep onset time if it was between 8:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m., and having an early or late sleep onset time if it was outside this range. These categories were selected by adding or subtracting 2 hours from the median sleep onset time of 10:00 p.m Sleep-facilitating behaviours Four behaviours that facilitate sleep were assessed. Electronic devices in the bedroom: Participants were asked whether they had a television or other type of electronic device in their bedroom while sleeping, even if turned off.Note 13 Electronic media use before bed: Participants were asked for the usual length of time between stopping use of electronics (e.g., television, phone, tablet, computer, video game system) and sleep onset, in the prior 7 days.Note 13 Participants were categorized as using electronic media before bed if they were used within 30 minutes before sleep, in line with other studies.Note 16Note 17 Physical activity recommendation: To meet the physical activity recommendation within Canada’s 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, individuals must obtain ≥150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week.Note 9 Previous recommendations specified that MVPA should be obtained in bouts of 10 minutes or more. While this stipulation was removed in the October 2020 update,Note 9 data were collected based on the former recommendation. Therefore, participants were asked for the amount of time they spent each day in the prior week doing physical activity where they sweated or breathed harder (i.e., MVPA), in bouts of 10 minutes or more.Note 13 Those who accumulated ≥150 or more minutes of MVPA over the prior week in bouts of 10 minutes or more were classified as meeting the physical activity recommendation, whereas those who accumulated <150 minutes or did not participate in MVPA were classified as not meeting the recommendation. Screen time recommendation: To meet the screen time recommendation within Canada’s 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, individuals must limit their recreational screen time to no more than 3 hours per day.Note 9 Participants were asked for the usual amount of time they spent per day watching television or a screen on any electronic device while sitting or lying down in 2-hour increments (“2 hours or less per day,” “more than 2 hours but less than 4 hours,” “4 hours to less than 6 hours,” etc.).Note 13 Individuals who answered “2 hours or less per day” or “more than 2 hours but less than 4 hours” were categorized as meeting sedentary behaviour recommendations, whereas those who reported greater amounts were classified as not meeting the recommendation. Sociodemographic characteristics Participants were characterized by age, sex, socioeconomic status defined by household education and household income adequacy, and employment status in the week prior to the survey. Age was categorized using a life cycle approach (18 to 34, 35 to 49, 50 to 64, or 65 and older), and as adult (18 to 64) or older adult (65 and older). Household education was defined as the highest level of education attained among all members of a participant’s household, categorized as “less than high school,” “high school graduate,” or “postsecondary graduate.” Household income adequacy was derived by adjusting total household income for household size and reported as quintiles based on a weighted distribution. Employment status was categorized as “employed,” “unemployed” and “retired.” Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to calculate means, percentages and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for sleep indicators overall and by sociodemographic characteristics. Means and percentages were calculated using survey weights to be representative of the 10 provinces. Bootstrap weights were used to calculate 95% CIs. Two-tailed hypothesis tests were used to assess differences in means and percentages between groups under a significance level of 0.05. Analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, North Carolina) with SAS-callable SUDAAN version 11. Results Among Canadian adults aged 18 to 64, mean sleep duration was 7.9 hours per night, with 77% meeting sleep duration recommendations (Table 1). Among older adults, mean sleep duration was 8.1 hours per night, with 55% meeting sleep duration recommendations. The percentage of adults exceeding sleep duration recommendations was 5% for ages 18 to 64 and 29% for older adults, while the percentage of adults below the recommendations was 18% for ages 18 to 64 and 15% for older adults (Figure 1). Adults with the highest household education and income adequacy were more likely to meet sleep duration recommendations than those with the lowest, but had lower mean sleep duration. Adults with the lowest household education and income adequacy were more likely to exceed recommendations than those with the highest. Among adults aged 18 to 64, employed individuals had lower mean sleep duration than unemployed and retired individuals, while among older adults, employed individuals had lower mean sleep duration than retirees only. Sleep duration was lowest for adults aged 35 to 49. Sleep duration recommendation adherence was similar between 18- to 34-year-olds, 35- to 49-year-olds, and 50- to 64-year-olds (Figure 2a, b). ﻿ Table 1-1 Sleep duration and adherence to sleep duration

Among adults aged 18 to 64, 61% reported high sleep quality, compared with 71% of older adults (Table 2). The majority of those aged 18 to 64 had variable sleep (i.e., ≥30 minute difference in sleep duration, wake time and sleep onset time between work and free days), while the majority of adults aged 65 and older had low sleep variability. For those aged 18 to 64, 57% had a sleep onset time between 8:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m., compared with 72% of older adults. Use of electronic media within 30 minutes of bedtime was reported by 68% of adults aged 18 to 64 and 60% of older adults. The presence of electronic devices in the bedroom while sleeping was reported by 71% of those aged 18 to 64 and 41% of older adults. Adults younger than 65 were more likely to meet physical activity recommendations but less likely to meet those for recreational screen time than older adults. ﻿ Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Table summary This table displays the results of Self-rated sleep quality 18 years and older, 18 to 64 years, Both sexes (n=9,248), Males (n=4,159), Females (n=5,089), Both sexes (n=6,140), Males (n=2,822), Females (n=3,318), Estimate and 95% CI (appearing as column headers). 18 years and older 18 to 64 years Both sexes (n=9,248) Males (n=4,159) Females (n=5,089) Both sexes (n=6,140) Males (n=2,822) Females (n=3,318) Estimate 95% CI Estimate 95% CI Estimate 95% CI Estimate 95% CI Estimate 95% CI Estimate 95% CI from to from to from to from to from to from to Excellent or good self-rated sleep quality 63.1 61.2 64.9 65.8 62.8 68.7 60.5Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡ 58.0 62.9 60.9 58.7 63.1 63.7 60.0 67.1 58.2Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡ 55.3 61.1 < 30-minute difference in sleep duration between weekdays and weekends 42.8 41.1 44.4 42.0 39.5 44.5 43.5 41.3 45.7 34.7 32.7 36.7 34.1 31.2 37.2 35.2 32.5 38.0 < 30-minute difference in wake-up time between weekdays and weekends 40.8 39.2 42.5 38.7 36.2 41.2 42.8Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡ 40.7 44.9 31.1 29.1 33.2 29.0 26.1 32.1 33.1Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡ 30.6 35.7 < 30-minute difference in time to fall asleep between weekdays and weekends 55.1 53.4 56.7 51.5 49.0 53.9 58.4Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 56.1 60.7 47.3 45.3 49.4 43.5 40.6 46.5 51.1Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 48.2 54.0 Average sleep onset between 8:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. 59.8 58.1 61.5 55.1 52.5 57.6 64.3Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 62.0 66.4 56.7 54.6 58.7 50.8 47.8 53.7 62.4Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 59.7 65.0 Average sleep onset between 12:01 a.m. and 7:59 p.m. 40.2 38.5 41.9 44.9 42.4 47.5 35.7Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 33.6 38.0 43.3 41.3 45.4 49.2 46.3 52.2 37.6Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 35.0 40.3 Has an electronic device in their bedroom 64.6 63.0 66.2 65.3 62.9 67.6 64.0 61.9 66.2 70.8 68.8 72.7 71.1 68.2 73.7 70.5 67.7 73.1 Uses an electronic device within 30 minutes of falling asleep 66.2 64.5 67.9 67.5 64.9 69.9 65.0 62.8 67.2 67.7 65.7 69.7 68.7 65.7 71.6 66.8 64.1 69.4 Meets physical activity recommendation (150 minutes of MVPA per week) 55.1 53.4 56.8 60.2 57.6 62.7 50.3Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 48.0 52.6 58.8 56.7 60.9 63.4 60.3 66.4 54.4Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 51.6 57.2 Meets screen time recommendation (< 3 hours per day of leisure-time screen use) 77.5 75.8 79.1 73.9 71.2 76.4 80.8Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 78.8 82.7 72.8 70.7 74.9 69.0 65.8 72.1 76.5Table 2-1 Self-rated sleep quality, variability and hygiene factors, by age group and sex Note ‡‡ 74.0 78.9 Note ‡ significantly different from estimate for males of same age (p < 0.05) Return to note ‡ referrer Note ‡‡ significantly different from estimate for males of same age (p < 0.001) Return to note ‡‡ referrer Notes: CI = confidence interval; MVPA = moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

Adults and older adults who reported high sleep quality were more likely to meet sleep duration recommendations than those who reported low sleep quality (78% vs. 65%) (Table 3). Among those aged 18 to 64, individuals who had ≥30-minute differences in sleep and wake times between work and free days, with moderate sleep onset timing, and who met screen time recommendations were more likely to meet sleep duration recommendations. Among older adults, individuals who met physical activity recommendations were more likely to meet those for sleep duration. Adherence to sleep duration recommendations did not differ by electronic device use, nor by the presence of devices in the bedroom in either age group. ﻿ Table 3-1 Percentage of adults meeting the

While average sleep duration was longer for adults aged 65 and older compared with adults aged 18 to 64, the percentage meeting sleep duration recommendations was lower among older adults because many of them (30%) exceeded 8 hours of sleep. Long sleep duration in older adults has been associated with poor sleep quality, poor general health and morbidity.Note 1 Excessive sleep may also signal the need for medical, neurological or psychiatric evaluation.Note 1 By contrast, adults aged 18 to 64 were more likely to be below the sleep duration recommendations than exceed them. Sleep duration was lowest for Canadians aged 35 to 49, possibly attributable to increased work and family demands.Note 18Employed individuals get less sleep than unemployed or retired individuals in both the current study and other studies.Note 18 However, the percentage of adults meeting sleep duration recommendations did not differ for ages 35 to 49 compared with others because of a smaller percentage of over-sleepers. Females reported slightly longer sleep durations than males and were more likely to meet related recommendations. This was consistent with findings from 2007 to 2013.Note 12 Females were less likely to meet recommendations among older adults because there were more over-sleepers in this group. Similar to previous findings,Note 12 those in the highest-income households and with the highest education were more likely to meet recommendations than those in the lowest-income households and with the lowest education. Mean sleep duration was higher among those with lower income and education, particularly in older adults, suggesting a higher proportion of over-sleepers in individuals of lower socioeconomic status. Longer sleep durations were reported in this 2020 study, compared with national estimates from 2014 to 2015 and 2007 to 2013.Note 11Note 12 Mean sleep duration was 7.2 hours for all adults from 2014 to 2015, and 7.1 hours for adults and 7.2 hours for older adults from 2007 to 2013—compared with 7.9 hours for adults and 8.1 hours for older adults in 2020. However, the method of data collection differed between studies. In the analysis from 2007 to 2013 analysis, respondents reported their total hours of sleep per night, while in the present analysis, sleep duration was the difference between self-reported usual sleep onset time and wake time. The results of the present study are similar to those from the 2005 General Social Survey, which reported an average sleep duration of 8.2 hours for Canadians aged 15 and older, based on sleep and wake times recorded using 24-hour time-use diaries.Note 19 Sleep quality About two-thirds of respondents reported excellent or good sleep quality. Consistent with findings from 2007 to 2013,Note 12 high sleep quality was more common in older adults compared with younger adults, and among males compared with females. The percentage of adults reporting high sleep quality was higher in 2020 than during the 2007-to-2013 period (51% in adults and 50% in older adults from 2007 to 2013, compared with 61% and 71%, respectively, in 2020). However, sleep quality was assessed by asking respondents how often they had trouble going to sleep or staying asleep, rather than having respondents rate their overall sleep quality. The higher estimates in 2020 might be attributable to differences in methodology, rather than better sleep quality. Poor sleep quality is associated with negative health outcomes and may be as important—if not more—than sleep duration in predicting health.Note 20 Sleep quality is impacted by sleep hygiene practices,Note 7 environmental factors, and physical and mental health.Note 21Note 22Note 23 Self-rated sleep quality is also affected by an individual’s beliefs and expectations about sleep, such as the optimal duration and time to sleep.Note 5 There was a clear association between sleep quality and sleep duration, with individuals who reported high sleep quality more likely to meet sleep duration recommendations than those reporting low sleep quality. This association was present across both age groups and sexes, but was more pronounced among adults aged 18 to 64. This finding is in line with those from the 2007-to-2013 CHMS.Note 12 Work and free day sleep variability While half of adults aged 18 to 64 reported high variability in sleep onset time between work or school days and free days (or weekdays and weekends if not applicable), two-thirds of adults reported high variability in sleep duration and wake time. The discrepancy in sleep between work and free days is often referred to as “social jet lag.”Note 24By contrast, older adults had low variability in sleep duration, sleep onset time and wake time, likely caused by minimal work commitments.Note 25Note 26 Adults aged 18 to 64 with low variability in sleep onset and wake time were somewhat less likely to meet sleep duration recommendations. There was no difference in the proportion of older adults meeting sleep duration recommendations by sleep variability. Working adults may compensate for short work-day sleep with long free-day or weekend sleep. This may not be a concern if individuals are still averaging between 7 and 9 hours of sleep, as free-day or weekend catch-up sleep has been associated with favourable health outcomes compared with short sleep durations on both work and free days.Note 6Note 26 Sleep onset timing Although there are no established recommendations for sleep timing, later sleep times have been associated with adverse health outcomes.Note 6 Most Canadians reported moderate sleep onset times, with 57% of adults aged 18 to 64 and 72% of older adults falling asleep between 8:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. Adults with that range of sleep onset time were more likely to meet sleep duration guidelines than those outside this range, but not older adults. This is likely attributable to later sleepers in the 18-to-64 age group having shorter sleep durations because of work commitments.Note 18 Sleep-facilitating behaviours Although many factors contribute to sleep hygiene (e.g., alcohol and caffeine consumption, bedroom temperature, noise, relaxing period before bed),Note 27 the 2020 CCHS was limited to the measurement of a few sleep facilitating behaviours: electronic media use behaviours, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Use of electronic media within 30 minutes of sleep time and the presence of electronic devices in the bedroom were commonly reported by Canadian adults. Although previousstudies have found associations between the use of electronics in the bedroom and shorter sleep duration, lower sleep qualityNote 28Note 29 and greater sleep variability,Note 30 there was no association between the use of electronics and meeting sleep duration recommendations in this study. It may be that individuals who did not use electronics engaged in other detrimental practices, such as mental activities, before sleeping.Note 27 Alternatively, individuals who used electronics before bed may have compensated for lower sleep quality with a longer duration in bed. While exercising immediately before bedtime is considered detrimental to sleep,Note 27 regular exercise during the day is thought to have beneficial effects on sleep duration and quality, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear.Note 31 In this study, older adults who met physical activity recommendations were more likely to meet sleep duration recommendations, compared with those who did not meet physical activity recommendations. There was no association in adults aged 18 to 64. However, current evidence does not suggest that age moderates the benefits of physical activity on sleep.Note 31 Given the work or school demands of adults aged 18 to 64, they may have less time to allocate toward both sufficient sleep and physical activity, compared with older adults. Previous studies have found associations between longer screen time and shorter sleep duration.Note 32Note 33Note 34 In this study, adults aged 18 to 64 who met recreational screen time recommendations were more likely to meet sleep duration recommendations than those who did not. No association was observed in older adults, although 5% did not meet sleep recommendations. While excessive screen time may lead to shorter sleep duration through biological mechanisms, it may also take time away from sleep.Note 9 Adults aged 18 to 64 may be less likely than older adults to have both excessive screen time and sufficient sleep because of work or school demands. Strengths This was the first large, nationally representative study conducted to provide reliable estimates of sleep indicators in Canadian adults since 2014 to 2015. It is also the first to report the sleep health of Canadians since the release of the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines in October 2020. Estimates were reported not only for sleep duration, but also for sleep quality, variability, timing and facilitating behaviours. Additionally, associations between meeting sleep duration recommendations and sleep quality, variability, timing and several sleep-facilitating behaviours were assessed. The associations with sleep variability, timing and facilitating behaviours had not previously been explored on a national level. Limitations Data for this study were self-reported and collected by questionnaire. The way questions about sleep are phrased can greatly impact estimates.Note 35 While sleep duration was assessed by asking respondents for their usual sleep and wake times on work or school days and free days in this study, as recommended,Note 36 respondents were asked for their usual hours of sleep per night in the 2007-to-2013 CHMS.Note 12 Sleep durations derived from these two methods may differ in accuracy;Note 37 therefore, direct comparisons cannot be made over time. Furthermore, data were not available to assess night-to-night variability in sleep, which has been associated with adverse outcomes independent of average sleep duration.Note 38 Device-based sleep measurements (e.g., actigraphy) provide more accurate estimates and can capture night-to-night variability,Note 35 although they are more expensive for an equivalent sample size and not comparable with most existing sleep estimates or public health guidelines that are based on self-reported sleep duration. In addition, data were not available on naps, nor total 24-hour sleep time (as opposed to nighttime sleep). Napping is frequent in older adults, and common in younger and middle-aged adults as a way to compensate for short nighttime sleep duration.Note 39 It has been associated with both beneficial and adverse outcomes.Note 39 Respondents were asked to rate their overall sleep quality, indicators of which include sleep efficiency (total sleep time compared with time in bed), sleep latency (time to sleep), overnight awakenings and time spent awake after sleep onset, among others.Note 5 Data on these individual indicators, as well as additional sleep hygiene factors,Note 27 are needed for a comprehensive understanding of sleep health. Physical activity recommendation adherence was assessed using recommendations from 2011. They specified that 150 minutes of MVPA per week must be obtained in bouts of 10 minutes or more. The 24-Hour Movement Guidelines released in October 2020 removed the bout stipulation, so estimates from this study do not precisely reflect the current recommendations. Removal of the bout stipulation has had a considerable impact on the percentage of Canadians classified as meeting the MVPA recommendations,Note 40 and additional research will be required to determine how adherence to the new recommendations is associated with sleep health. In addition, screen time was assessed using a categorical response variable, and response options were not aligned with the 3-hour cutoff of the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines. This was a cross-sectional study, preventing inferences on causality and the directionality between outcomes. For instance, while excessive screen time may impact sleep duration, shorter sleep duration might promote recreational screen time over other activities. Future studies should investigate the temporality between sleep and sleep-facilitating behaviours. Finally, the data used in this study were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent surveys have suggested changes in the sleep habits of Canadians during the pandemic, including decreased sleep duration and quality.Note 41 Given the timing of this current study (January to March 2020), these results can be used as a benchmark for the sleep behaviours of Canadians before the pandemic. Efforts should be made to examine sleep health on a national level during the pandemic and after to estimate any long-term impacts on sleep behaviour. Conclusion Three-quarters of Canadian adults meet the sleep duration recommendations of the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines. However, poor sleep quality and high sleep variability are common, particularly among adults aged 18 to 64. To maximize the health benefits of sleep, continued efforts are needed to promote proper sleep duration and to improve sleep quality, consistency and hygiene. Device-based measures of sleep would provide more accurate estimates for population-level surveillance and research on the relationship between sleep and health outcomes. These findings provide a benchmark for the sleep health of Canadians before the COVID-19 pandemic. Further surveillance and research are needed to assess the impact of the pandemic on sleep behaviour. References Reference 1. Hirshkowitz M, Whiton K, Albert SM, et al.

Research shows older adults are the most vulnerable to falls (63%), but half of adolescents and 35 per cent of working-age adults have suffered a fall over a one-year period. There are steps we can take to build up our strength and stability, balance and flexibility to reduce the risk of falls, twists and tears. It's called ‘prehabilitation’ and it's an approach to avoid injuries, and recover more effectively when you DO hurt yourself. What is prehabilitation? Prehab exercises build ‘functional fitness’ which is the ability to perform life’s daily activities (both required and recreational) with the required strength, stamina and suppleness to keep you moving the way you need to. Performing functional exercises regularly (as part of an exercise routine) can not only make you more resistant to injury but can also help correct or lessen the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and ideally keep you out of the rehabilitation phase. Prehabilitation exercises can: Improve posture and correct movement patterns Equalize imbalances in muscle length, joint alignment and flexibility Improve core stability (upper, lower and left vs right) Boost muscle strength, endurance and power Connect your mind with muscle movements and joint stability Try building these 5 prehab exercises into your workout regularly to help prevent injuries: Abdominal brace: Consistent core stability helps support the lower back, stabilize your pelvis (aka hips), improves balance and can help you catch yourself BEFORE you fall. Hip hinge: This move requires you to bend at the hip while keeping your spine and neck in alignment. This is a great move for building hip and core strength to support the lower back. Single leg squat: This move builds leg and hip strength, stability and balance for day-to-day activities such as walking, jogging, climbing, bending over to pick things up (gardening, cleaning, golfing). Single leg hip bridge: Strong glutes help support the lower back and can improve alignment from the hips to the ankles. Plank/Hover: This exercise builds overall core (abdominals, back, shoulder girdle and hip) muscles, for greater strength, stability and endurance. Not only that, but this move will help boost confidence that in the case of a fall, your mind and body will remember how to ‘break your fall’ and ‘brace’ against impact forces.

Although taking your workout routine to the great outdoors is a great way to enjoy the fresh air and sunny conditions, the heat can take a toll on your body. If you’re someone who prefers to exercise in the sunshine, keep these eight tips in mind to stay healthy, safe and fit this summer. Wear moisture wicking clothes in light colors Light-weight moisture-wicking clothes in bright colours are ideal for working out in the heat. Light colours don’t absorb light; they reflect it, which helps you stay cool longer. For more information and tips on what to wear while working out check out this article! Split up your workouts Break up your longer workouts into shorter ones throughout the day. If it’s humid out, it’s probably best to shorten your workout to 10- or 15-minute segments. Timing is everything In the summer months, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is usually the hottest time of the day when the UV index is highest. If you’re planning on exercising outdoors, try to do it on either side of that time. Head indoors On days where there’s an excessive heat warning, it’s better to be safe than sorry. When you can’t beat the heat, there’s nothing wrong with exercising in a temperature-controlled gym or at home. Drink the right amount of water If you’re working out on a hot day, be sure to drink at least two litres of water throughout the day. A general rule of thumb is that you should consume 500 ml of water per hour of exercise. Once you’ve completed your workout, continue to drink 500 ml of water per hour for a few hours after you’ve finished exercising. One sip at a time Avoid taking big gulps or chugging your water. Instead, sip away on your water throughout the day, you’ll maximize the absorption of fluid, keeping your body hydrated longer. For more hydration hacks that will keep you cool and refreshed all summer long, check out this article. Workout in the water Take up a water sport like paddle boarding, kayaking or swimming to stay cool. Know your limits Listen to your body. Symptoms of heat stroke include headache, dizziness, confusion and sunburn. The onset of these symptoms could be sudden or gradual, so if you are experiencing one or more of these symptoms, get out of the heat and drink lots of water. If symptoms persist or worsen seek medical attention immediately. Was this article helpful? Yes No Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, barbecue or grill pan, knife, cutting board, mixing bowls and tongs Instructions Preheat the barbecue or grill pan to high heat. Wash the vegetables and cut them into long spears (so they don't fall through the grates on the barbecue). Drizzle the veggies with avocado oil and season them with sea salt and pepper to taste. Grill the veggies on one side until they become slightly charred. Turn once and grill the other side quickly to preserve some crunch in the vegetables (about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on size of vegetables and power of grill). Remove the charred vegetables from the barbecue, chop them into bite-size pieces and set aside. Crumble the goat cheese and have it standing by. Rip the pea shoots into thirds by hand and set them aside as well. To make the vinaigrette, combine the juice of the grilled lemon, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, minced ginger, chili flakes, xylitol sweetener, apple cider vinegar, olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk vigorously to incorporate all ingredients into a creamy emulsified dressing. Place the arugula on a platter and top with the chopped and charred vegetables. Drizzle the dressing all over and finish with the crumbled goat cheese and the fresh pea shoots. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

The body’s reaction to that kind of injury is to swell up, which is called acute inflammation. But there’s another, less obvious and not-so-visible kind of inflammation – chronic inflammation. It occurs within the body, and has become more prevalent as more people experience symptoms. Acute and chronic inflammation occur because the immune system releases white blood cells in response to a perceived attack. When an injury happens, we can actually see our immune system in action. Chronic inflammation is harder to detect, but is important to notice because it can be linked to serious diseases. If the body feels like it’s under constant attack from things like air pollutants, stress, unhealthy foods or fatigue, it can lead to chronic inflammation. Research shows chronic inflammation can contribute to heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and even cancer, among other illnesses. There are still many unknowns about its effects on our overall health, but we know for sure that healthy nutrition and movement habits that can reduce chronic inflammation. While it’s important to know how to fight chronic inflammation, it’s also helpful to be aware of food and lifestyle choices that can trigger it. Try to avoid or limit your consumption of refined carbs, fried foods, sugary drinks, red and processed meats, and unhealthy fats like margarine and lard. Passing on these foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels, and lower exposure to toxins. You can take steps to reduce chronic inflammation by getting plenty of high-quality sleep and moving your body every day. Eat foods known to have a high level of antioxidants, like berries, onions, green tea, olive oil, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, turmeric, dry roasted nuts, and fatty fish (eg: salmon, tuna). An overall healthy diet complemented by an active lifestyle is the best defense against chronic inflammation and the diseases it can cause. If you’re really serious about a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods, you may want to consider giving the Mediterranean diet a try. Was this article helpful?

-Starbucks hacks | The GoodLife Fitness Blog <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none;" alt="" src="https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?event=init&amp;tid=2612603590493&amp;pd[em]=<hashed_email_address>&amp;noscript=1"> GoodLife_Logo MOVE Weight Loss Workouts Group Fitness Fitness Advice FUEL Recipes Weight Loss Nutrition Meal Planning LIVE Motivation Lifestyle Mindfulness Member Stories SUBSCRIBE Press "Enter" to search × Kirstin Schell —GoodLife Fitness Registered Holistic Nutritionist (RHN) August 03, 2022 Starbucks hacks Make your favourite drink a little bit healthier 203,598 views 2 min × If you have a soft spot for Starbucks, you’re definitely in good company! Few people can resist the caffeinated goodness, plus it offers what seems like endless delicious beverage options. If ‘treat yo self’ is your motto you’ve probably made a trip to the 'bucks here and there. Although delicious, ordering a frap with extra whipped cream and some chocolate drizzle isn’t the healthiest option. Calories and sugar content can really add up, and it’s important to try not to drink your calories. Here are some hacks to make your next trip to Starbucks a little healthier… but still delicious: Order a smaller size If you order a smaller size, you’re saving calories while still getting your Starbucks fix. While it might not seem like a lot to take a 20-ounce Venti order down to a 16-ounce Grande, you’re getting less of everything — calories, fat, and sugar. Choose your milk wisely Starbucks offers a variety of milks – including almond milk, soy milk and coconut milk. Different types of milk have different benefits, calorie contents, etc. Check out this chart for a breakdown of different options. Typically, when you order a drink that contains milk, Starbucks uses 2 percent, unless you specify otherwise. So if you want your drink made dairy-free, with whole milk, with non-fat milk or something else, make sure you say so! Skip the whipped cream Added toppings mean added calories. Whipped cream can add at least 50 calories to your drink. For example, a Grande nonfat Caffè Mocha can go from 290 calories to 360 when whipped cream is added. If you’re adding whipped topping, you can also expect to consume a lot more fat (15g versus the 8g with no whipped cream) as well. Order light or skinny Starbucks also offers ‘skinny’ or ‘light’ options. Skinny options are made with nonfat milk, sugar-free syrup and no whipped cream. Light drinks usually come with nonfat milk, light syrup, and ice for fewer calories. Opt for unsweetened If you want to make a healthy change, avoid the sweeteners altogether. Syrups skyrocket sugar and calorie content. Consuming these sweet syrups also can trigger sweets cravings, causing you to eat/drink even more sugar! Get back to basics When in doubt, go back to the basics – coffee, tea, espresso and cappuccino are the best options when treating yourself to a caffeinated beverage. If you’re trying to make your caffeine fix a little bit healthier, just say no to the high-in-calories, high-in-sugar Frappuccino. Was this article helpful?

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low, cover with lid, and cook for 15 minutes. When done, remove lid, fluff with a fork and let cool. Beets: Place washed beets in the centre of some aluminum foil, and wrap them up quite tightly. Place package in a preheated 350° oven for 60-90 minutes depending on size. Beets should be soft enough to poke with a knife when cooked. When done, let cool slightly, then trim off the top and bottom of each beet, then the skin should slide right off. Cut each peeled beet into 8 pieces and transfer to a bowl. Roasted garlic: Lay out another piece of aluminum foil, trim the bottom 1 cm off of a bulb of garlic, and then place on foil cut side up. Sprinkle with sea salt, and drizzle with 1/4 teaspoon avocado oil. Wrap up tightly and place into a preheated 350° oven for 45 minutes. When done, remove from oven, and squeeze garlic bulb to remove roasted garlic cloves. Broccoli and peppers: Chop peppers into large chunks and transfer to a bowl. Chop jalapeño into a small dice, and add to the same bowl. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon avocado oil, and season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly, then transfer to one side of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Next chop the broccoli into small florettes and place into a bowl. Drizzle with the other tablespoon of avocado oil, and season with sea salt and pepper. Mix well, then transfer to the other side of the parchment lined baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350° for 15 to 20 minutes or until broccoli is cooked to the level you want it. Roasted garlic tahini dressing: Place all dressing ingredients into a small blender and purée until smooth, transfer to a squeeze bottle. Put it all together: Divide the cooked quinoa into 3 containers. Add 1/3 of the cooked and chopped beets, 1/3 of the roasted peppers and 1/3 of the roasted broccoli to each container. Top each portion with approx. 2 tbsp of the dressing and 1/3 of the micro greens. Recipe will last 4-5 days in the fridge. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

Few people can resist the caffeinated goodness, plus it offers what seems like endless delicious beverage options. If ‘treat yo self’ is your motto you’ve probably made a trip to the 'bucks here and there. Although delicious, ordering a frap with extra whipped cream and some chocolate drizzle isn’t the healthiest option. Calories and sugar content can really add up, and it’s important to try not to drink your calories. Here are some hacks to make your next trip to Starbucks a little healthier… but still delicious: Order a smaller size If you order a smaller size, you’re saving calories while still getting your Starbucks fix. While it might not seem like a lot to take a 20-ounce Venti order down to a 16-ounce Grande, you’re getting less of everything — calories, fat, and sugar. Choose your milk wisely Starbucks offers a variety of milks – including almond milk, soy milk and coconut milk. Different types of milk have different benefits, calorie contents, etc. Check out this chart for a breakdown of different options. Typically, when you order a drink that contains milk, Starbucks uses 2 percent, unless you specify otherwise. So if you want your drink made dairy-free, with whole milk, with non-fat milk or something else, make sure you say so! Skip the whipped cream Added toppings mean added calories. Whipped cream can add at least 50 calories to your drink. For example, a Grande nonfat Caffè Mocha can go from 290 calories to 360 when whipped cream is added. If you’re adding whipped topping, you can also expect to consume a lot more fat (15g versus the 8g with no whipped cream) as well. Order light or skinny Starbucks also offers ‘skinny’ or ‘light’ options. Skinny options are made with nonfat milk, sugar-free syrup and no whipped cream. Light drinks usually come with nonfat milk, light syrup, and ice for fewer calories. Opt for unsweetened If you want to make a healthy change, avoid the sweeteners altogether. Syrups skyrocket sugar and calorie content. Consuming these sweet syrups also can trigger sweets cravings, causing you to eat/drink even more sugar! Get back to basics When in doubt, go back to the basics – coffee, tea, espresso and cappuccino are the best options when treating yourself to a caffeinated beverage. If you’re trying to make your caffeine fix a little bit healthier, just say no to the high-in-calories, high-in-sugar Frappuccino. Was this article helpful?

But not all of the information out there is completely accurate, and what works for one body may not benefit another. If you’re just getting into fitness, or are looking to ramp up your fitness knowledge, it’s a good idea to double check information and recommendations you receive if you want to avoid an injury, overexertion or other negative consequences. Bad advice can slow down your progress at the gym – which could lead you to give up. Here are five common pieces of bad fitness advice. No pain, no gain An oldie, but not a goodie. As you perform weight training movements, tiny tears occur in the muscle tissue. As they heal, you may experience pain known as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). This can promote, but is not required to build muscle. DOMS is most common when you’ve tried a new exercise. So, you can successfully work toward your fitness goals without soreness being a part of everyday life. Running or deep squats are bad for your knees The movements won’t cause knee damage, but using improper form while doing them certainly could. Muscular imbalances in the body are quite common, but may also cause people to perform exercises the wrong way. This can lead to soreness in the knees, hips or back. It’s best to consult with a fitness professional to assess your movements and ensure you’re using proper form and technique. Fasting before a workout burns more fat Working out on an empty stomach is not proven to burn more fat and can lead to negative and even harmful outcomes. It may cause blood sugar levels to drop which can make you feel lightheaded or even faint, and can deprive you of the energy you need to get the most out of your workout. When it’s not getting energy from carbs, your body will dip into its protein and amino acid stores, reducing your overall muscle mass, which results in a slower day-to-day fat burn. Heavy weights will cause women to get too bulky The first and most obvious rebuttal to this statement is that each person can decide what body composition they desire, and design their workouts to help them achieve those results. That said, women can have a different hormone profile than their male counterparts, so the chances of a woman achieving a similar muscle mass compared to a typical man are less likely. Also, women who work out with heavy weights can enjoy benefits such as boosting fat burn while improving bone density, posture and stamina, all while building confidence and enhancing brain function. Weight train to muscle failure Forcing yourself to perform as many reps as you can until your body can’t do another isn’t the best approach to strength training. It increases the likelihood that your technique will suffer, which will also increase your risk of injury. That’s not to say that training to muscle failure can’t be used as a tool to maximize muscle growth, but it must be used strategically in periodized workouts. It’s best to seek the advice of a fitness professional and always have a spotter if you’re planning to lift to muscle failure. The next time you get or give fitness advice, make sure you look at the big picture and be realistic about what makes sense. What does your body need, based on your current age, stress level and injury history? It’s best to do what you enjoy, have a proper health and fitness plan, and don’t be afraid to speak to a fitness professional to help you stay on the right track. Was this article helpful?

The holidays are over, the snow has overstayed its welcome, and although spring is just around the corner, you still have to endure a few more weeks of ice-cold mornings scraping your car and shoveling snow. We’re here to help! Here are 5 ways you can beat the winter blues. GEAR UP No one will get excited about the weather if they’re not dressed for it, so make sure you have proper attire. Get yourself a warm pair of boots that are also waterproof. Fuzzy, cozy footwear is great until the snow seeps through and hits your feet. Once your socks are wet and cold, there’s little you can do to warm back up. Wearing mittens instead of gloves can make a big difference. With mitts, your fingers stay together, generating more body heat. Whereas gloves might allow you to be more dexterous, your hands will be warmer in mittens. Invest in a good coat, ideally, one that’s long enough to cover some of your legs and not just your torso. EAT YOUR VITAMIN D Vitamin D is important year-round, but it’s more challenging to get the recommended dose when the sun is only out for a few hours a day. To get your fix of vitamin D, try eating foods like salmon, canned tuna, vitamin D-fortified milk, and egg yolks. FIND AN ACTIVITY THAT YOU CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT The cold weather will be more enjoyable if you have a hobby. Instead of waiting for the snow to melt, embrace the cold for the unique opportunities it provides. Try snowshoeing, skating, skiing or snowboarding. If you'd rather be indoors, try hitting the gym. The benefits that regular exercise has on physical health are well-known and widely discussed but there are also incredible mental health benefits that working out offers. Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress and increase positive self-esteem, mood, and energy! START YOUR DAY EARLY When it’s cold out, you’re more tempted to snooze your alarm and stay under the blankets for as long as possible. But getting an early start to your day can help improve your mood and mental clarity. Wake up early, slow down and relax. Take the extra time to enjoy your breakfast and a cup of coffee instead of scrambling to get a bite on your way out the door. Better yet, try an early morning workout to get your day started before work or school. If you find it hard to motivate yourself early in the morning, pop into a Group Fitness Class and let the pros handle it! GET SOCIAL Everything is better with friends. When all else fails, and you just want to curl up with a cup of hot chocolate and stay indoors, go for it! But before you do, call up a friend and see if they want to come binge-watch Netflix or try some new recipes. Even though it’s cold out, it’s still important to socialize and catch up with friends and family. 5 façons de combattre la déprime hivernale Parce qu’il reste encore quelques semaines avant le printemps ! Presque partout au Canada, le mois de février est le mois le plus froid de l’année. La période des fêtes est terminée, la neige persiste, et même si le printemps se pointe le nez, il nous faudra endurer encore pendant quelques semaines des matins glacés à dégivrer la voiture et à pelleter l’entrée. Nous sommes ici pour vous aider ! Voici cinq façons de combattre la déprime hivernale. HABILLEZ-VOUS BIEN CHAUDEMENT! Personne ne s’emballera pour la saison d’hiver s’il ou elle n’est pas habillé∙e pour affronter le froid, alors assurez-vous d’avoir les bons vêtements ! Procurez-vous une bonne paire de bottes chaudes qui sont aussi imperméables. Les chaussures en peluche sont douillettes et confortables jusqu’à ce que la neige et la gadoue s’infiltrent et atteignent vos pieds ! Une fois vos chaussettes mouillées et froides, il n’y a plus rien à faire pour réchauffer vos pieds. Porter des mitaines plutôt que des gants peut faire une différence importante. Dans une mitaine, vos doigts restent ensemble, se réchauffant les uns les autres. Bien que les gants vous permettent une plus grande dextérité, vos doigts, isolés, gèleront plus rapidement. Investissez dans un bon manteau, idéalement assez long pour couvrir une partie de vos jambes, pas seulement le haut du corps. PRENEZ DE LA VITAMINE D Bien qu’un apport en vitamine D soit important tout au long de l’année, obtenir la bonne quantité est un défi lorsque les heures d’ensoleillement sont plus courtes en saison froide. Pour avoir la bonne dose de vitamine D, mangez des aliments tels le saumon, le thon en conserve, le lait enrichi de vitamine D, et les jaunes d’œufs. TROUVEZ UNE ACTIVITÉ QUI VOUS EMBALLERA Les températures froides seront plus plaisantes si vous avez un passe-temps. Plutôt que d’attendre impatiemment que la neige fonde, célébrez le froid pour les possibilités qu’elle recèle. Essayez la raquette, le patin, le ski, ou même la planche à neige ! Si vous êtes davantage du type casanier, allez au gym ! Les bienfaits qu’entraine l’exercice régulier sur la santé physique sont bien connus et font l’objet de bien des discussions, mais, d’incroyables bienfaits sur la santé mentale découlent également de l’entrainement physique. D’ailleurs, il a été démontré que l’exercice aérobique contribue à réduire l’anxiété, la dépression et le stress, et à augmenter l’estime de soi, l’humeur, et l’énergie ! COMMENCEZ VOTRE JOURNÉE PLUS TÔT Quand il fait froid dehors, vous êtes davantage tenté de retarder votre réveil et de rester sous les couvertures aussi longtemps que possible. Mais débuter la journée tôt peut contribuer à améliorer votre humeur et votre clarté mentale. Réveillez-vous tôt, ralentissez, et détendez-vous. Prenez ce temps pour savourer un bon petit-déjeuner et boire un bon café plutôt que de vous précipiter à l’extérieur avec une rôtie froide, vos mitaines, et votre café à emporter dans les mains. Encore mieux, essayez un entrainement matinal pour débuter votre journée de travail ou d’études. Si la motivation ne vous vient pas facilement si tôt le matin, joignez-vous à un cours de groupe et laissez un pro s’en occuper ! SOCIALISEZ Tout est toujours mieux quand on est en bonne compagnie. Quand tout a échoué, et que tout ce dont vous rêvez est de vous installer confortablement avec une tasse de chocolat chaud dans votre fauteuil préféré, faites-le ! Mais avant, appelez et invitez un∙e ami∙e pour écouter une série Netflix en rafale, ou pour essayer de nouvelles recettes. Même s’il fait froid dehors, il n’en demeure pas moins qu’il est important de socialiser et de prendre du temps avec des amis et la famille. Was this article helpful?

Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, barbecue or grill pan, knife, cutting board, mixing bowls and tongs Instructions Preheat the barbecue or grill pan to high heat. Wash the vegetables and cut them into long spears (so they don't fall through the grates on the barbecue). Drizzle the veggies with avocado oil and season them with sea salt and pepper to taste. Grill the veggies on one side until they become slightly charred. Turn once and grill the other side quickly to preserve some crunch in the vegetables (about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on size of vegetables and power of grill). Remove the charred vegetables from the barbecue, chop them into bite-size pieces and set aside. Crumble the goat cheese and have it standing by. Rip the pea shoots into thirds by hand and set them aside as well. To make the vinaigrette, combine the juice of the grilled lemon, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, minced ginger, chili flakes, xylitol sweetener, apple cider vinegar, olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk vigorously to incorporate all ingredients into a creamy emulsified dressing. Place the arugula on a platter and top with the chopped and charred vegetables. Drizzle the dressing all over and finish with the crumbled goat cheese and the fresh pea shoots. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

You’ve been feasting on the bounty of summer fruits and veggies, and might be sad to see it go. Remember that early fall is a great time for fresh, nutritious produce. Why it's better to eat what's in season? Eating produce when it’s fresh and in season has important benefits to you, local farmers and the environment. It’s tastier and more nutritious. When food is picked and eaten at its peak, it holds its flavour and nutritional value. Once picked, it loses nutrient content quickly - as much as 50% or more. It’s local. When food is local, you are getting it at its peak freshness. Buying homegrown stimulates your local economy and creates jobs. It also reduces environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions and extra packaging for shipping. Food that’s harvested locally, in season and in abundance is much cheaper. Visit your local farmers market for the freshest produce. You may even consider picking your own. What’s in season? Early fall has about as much bounty as summer. Many of the fresh fruits and veg you’ve enjoyed during the summer months are still available. Artichokes, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, corn, lettuce, potatoes, radishes, tomatoes … the list goes on. Here are some additional healthy produce options that fall brings, and some recipe ideas to get you eating: Apples and crabapples (low in fat, a good source of fibre and Vitamin C). Use them in salads, with oatmeal and in smoothies. Brussels sprouts (low in saturated fat and cholesterol, a good source of riboflavin, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, a very good source of fibre, and Vitamins A, C, K, thiamin, Vitamin B6, folate, potassium and manganese). Use them cooked or raw in a variety of salads or roasted as a delicious side. Cranberries (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins E and K, and a very good source of fibre, Vitamin C and manganese). Use them in sauces and vinaigrettes, salads, breads and smoothies. Eggplant (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins B6, C, K, thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, magnesium, phosphorus and copper, and a very good source of fibre, folate, potassium and manganese). Use it in dips, grain bowls and even curries. Grapes (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a very good source of Vitamin C and Vitamin K). Use them in salads, smoothies or just as a quick and easy snack. Pears (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamin C, and a very good source of fibre). Use them in a variety of salads, with oatmeal, and as a perfect complement to pork. Pumpkins (low in saturated fat, very low in cholesterol and sodium, a good source of thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, folate, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, and a very good source of Vitamins A, C, E, riboflavin, potassium, copper and manganese). Use them in soups, stir fry or chili. You can even substitute them for pasta or fries, and eat the seeds too! September is a bountiful time for you to embrace all of the healthy and delicious produce and meal options that come with early fall. It’s also a great opportunity to optimize on nutritious eating.

The holidays are over, the snow has overstayed its welcome, and although spring is just around the corner, you still have to endure a few more weeks of ice-cold mornings scraping your car and shoveling snow. We’re here to help! Here are 5 ways you can beat the winter blues. GEAR UP No one will get excited about the weather if they’re not dressed for it, so make sure you have proper attire. Get yourself a warm pair of boots that are also waterproof. Fuzzy, cozy footwear is great until the snow seeps through and hits your feet. Once your socks are wet and cold, there’s little you can do to warm back up. Wearing mittens instead of gloves can make a big difference. With mitts, your fingers stay together, generating more body heat. Whereas gloves might allow you to be more dexterous, your hands will be warmer in mittens. Invest in a good coat, ideally, one that’s long enough to cover some of your legs and not just your torso. EAT YOUR VITAMIN D Vitamin D is important year-round, but it’s more challenging to get the recommended dose when the sun is only out for a few hours a day. To get your fix of vitamin D, try eating foods like salmon, canned tuna, vitamin D-fortified milk, and egg yolks. FIND AN ACTIVITY THAT YOU CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT The cold weather will be more enjoyable if you have a hobby. Instead of waiting for the snow to melt, embrace the cold for the unique opportunities it provides. Try snowshoeing, skating, skiing or snowboarding. If you'd rather be indoors, try hitting the gym. The benefits that regular exercise has on physical health are well-known and widely discussed but there are also incredible mental health benefits that working out offers. Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress and increase positive self-esteem, mood, and energy! START YOUR DAY EARLY When it’s cold out, you’re more tempted to snooze your alarm and stay under the blankets for as long as possible.

Take the extra time to enjoy your breakfast and a cup of coffee instead of scrambling to get a bite on your way out the door. Better yet, try an early morning workout to get your day started before work or school. If you find it hard to motivate yourself early in the morning, pop into a Group Fitness Class and let the pros handle it! GET SOCIAL Everything is better with friends. When all else fails, and you just want to curl up with a cup of hot chocolate and stay indoors, go for it!

Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low, cover with lid, and cook for 15 minutes. When done, remove lid, fluff with a fork and let cool. Beets: Place washed beets in the centre of some aluminum foil, and wrap them up quite tightly. Place package in a preheated 350° oven for 60-90 minutes depending on size. Beets should be soft enough to poke with a knife when cooked. When done, let cool slightly, then trim off the top and bottom of each beet, then the skin should slide right off. Cut each peeled beet into 8 pieces and transfer to a bowl. Roasted garlic: Lay out another piece of aluminum foil, trim the bottom 1 cm off of a bulb of garlic, and then place on foil cut side up. Sprinkle with sea salt, and drizzle with 1/4 teaspoon avocado oil. Wrap up tightly and place into a preheated 350° oven for 45 minutes. When done, remove from oven, and squeeze garlic bulb to remove roasted garlic cloves. Broccoli and peppers: Chop peppers into large chunks and transfer to a bowl. Chop jalapeño into a small dice, and add to the same bowl. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon avocado oil, and season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly, then transfer to one side of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Next chop the broccoli into small florettes and place into a bowl. Drizzle with the other tablespoon of avocado oil, and season with sea salt and pepper. Mix well, then transfer to the other side of the parchment lined baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350° for 15 to 20 minutes or until broccoli is cooked to the level you want it. Roasted garlic tahini dressing: Place all dressing ingredients into a small blender and purée until smooth, transfer to a squeeze bottle. Put it all together: Divide the cooked quinoa into 3 containers. Add 1/3 of the cooked and chopped beets, 1/3 of the roasted peppers and 1/3 of the roasted broccoli to each container. Top each portion with approx. 2 tbsp of the dressing and 1/3 of the micro greens. Recipe will last 4-5 days in the fridge. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

You’ve been feasting on the bounty of summer fruits and veggies, and might be sad to see it go. Remember that early fall is a great time for fresh, nutritious produce. Why it's better to eat what's in season? Eating produce when it’s fresh and in season has important benefits to you, local farmers and the environment. It’s tastier and more nutritious. When food is picked and eaten at its peak, it holds its flavour and nutritional value. Once picked, it loses nutrient content quickly - as much as 50% or more. It’s local. When food is local, you are getting it at its peak freshness. Buying homegrown stimulates your local economy and creates jobs. It also reduces environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions and extra packaging for shipping. Food that’s harvested locally, in season and in abundance is much cheaper. Visit your local farmers market for the freshest produce. You may even consider picking your own. What’s in season? Early fall has about as much bounty as summer. Many of the fresh fruits and veg you’ve enjoyed during the summer months are still available. Artichokes, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, corn, lettuce, potatoes, radishes, tomatoes … the list goes on. Here are some additional healthy produce options that fall brings, and some recipe ideas to get you eating: Apples and crabapples (low in fat, a good source of fibre and Vitamin C). Use them in salads, with oatmeal and in smoothies. Brussels sprouts (low in saturated fat and cholesterol, a good source of riboflavin, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, a very good source of fibre, and Vitamins A, C, K, thiamin, Vitamin B6, folate, potassium and manganese). Use them cooked or raw in a variety of salads or roasted as a delicious side. Cranberries (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins E and K, and a very good source of fibre, Vitamin C and manganese). Use them in sauces and vinaigrettes, salads, breads and smoothies. Eggplant (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins B6, C, K, thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, magnesium, phosphorus and copper, and a very good source of fibre, folate, potassium and manganese). Use it in dips, grain bowls and even curries. Grapes (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a very good source of Vitamin C and Vitamin K). Use them in salads, smoothies or just as a quick and easy snack. Pears (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamin C, and a very good source of fibre). Use them in a variety of salads, with oatmeal, and as a perfect complement to pork. Pumpkins (low in saturated fat, very low in cholesterol and sodium, a good source of thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, folate, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, and a very good source of Vitamins A, C, E, riboflavin, potassium, copper and manganese). Use them in soups, stir fry or chili. You can even substitute them for pasta or fries, and eat the seeds too! September is a bountiful time for you to embrace all of the healthy and delicious produce and meal options that come with early fall. It’s also a great opportunity to optimize on nutritious eating.

Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, barbecue or grill pan, knife, cutting board, mixing bowls and tongs Instructions Preheat the barbecue or grill pan to high heat. Wash the vegetables and cut them into long spears (so they don't fall through the grates on the barbecue). Drizzle the veggies with avocado oil and season them with sea salt and pepper to taste. Grill the veggies on one side until they become slightly charred. Turn once and grill the other side quickly to preserve some crunch in the vegetables (about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on size of vegetables and power of grill). Remove the charred vegetables from the barbecue, chop them into bite-size pieces and set aside. Crumble the goat cheese and have it standing by. Rip the pea shoots into thirds by hand and set them aside as well. To make the vinaigrette, combine the juice of the grilled lemon, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, minced ginger, chili flakes, xylitol sweetener, apple cider vinegar, olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk vigorously to incorporate all ingredients into a creamy emulsified dressing. Place the arugula on a platter and top with the chopped and charred vegetables. Drizzle the dressing all over and finish with the crumbled goat cheese and the fresh pea shoots. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?

Research shows older adults are the most vulnerable to falls (63%), but half of adolescents and 35 per cent of working-age adults have suffered a fall over a one-year period. There are steps we can take to build up our strength and stability, balance and flexibility to reduce the risk of falls, twists and tears. It's called ‘prehabilitation’ and it's an approach to avoid injuries, and recover more effectively when you DO hurt yourself. What is prehabilitation? Prehab exercises build ‘functional fitness’ which is the ability to perform life’s daily activities (both required and recreational) with the required strength, stamina and suppleness to keep you moving the way you need to. Performing functional exercises regularly (as part of an exercise routine) can not only make you more resistant to injury but can also help correct or lessen the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and ideally keep you out of the rehabilitation phase. Prehabilitation exercises can: Improve posture and correct movement patterns Equalize imbalances in muscle length, joint alignment and flexibility Improve core stability (upper, lower and left vs right) Boost muscle strength, endurance and power Connect your mind with muscle movements and joint stability Try building these 5 prehab exercises into your workout regularly to help prevent injuries: Abdominal brace: Consistent core stability helps support the lower back, stabilize your pelvis (aka hips), improves balance and can help you catch yourself BEFORE you fall. Hip hinge: This move requires you to bend at the hip while keeping your spine and neck in alignment. This is a great move for building hip and core strength to support the lower back. Single leg squat: This move builds leg and hip strength, stability and balance for day-to-day activities such as walking, jogging, climbing, bending over to pick things up (gardening, cleaning, golfing). Single leg hip bridge: Strong glutes help support the lower back and can improve alignment from the hips to the ankles. Plank/Hover: This exercise builds overall core (abdominals, back, shoulder girdle and hip) muscles, for greater strength, stability and endurance. Not only that, but this move will help boost confidence that in the case of a fall, your mind and body will remember how to ‘break your fall’ and ‘brace’ against impact forces.

The body’s reaction to that kind of injury is to swell up, which is called acute inflammation. But there’s another, less obvious and not-so-visible kind of inflammation – chronic inflammation. It occurs within the body, and has become more prevalent as more people experience symptoms. Acute and chronic inflammation occur because the immune system releases white blood cells in response to a perceived attack. When an injury happens, we can actually see our immune system in action. Chronic inflammation is harder to detect, but is important to notice because it can be linked to serious diseases. If the body feels like it’s under constant attack from things like air pollutants, stress, unhealthy foods or fatigue, it can lead to chronic inflammation. Research shows chronic inflammation can contribute to heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and even cancer, among other illnesses. There are still many unknowns about its effects on our overall health, but we know for sure that healthy nutrition and movement habits that can reduce chronic inflammation. While it’s important to know how to fight chronic inflammation, it’s also helpful to be aware of food and lifestyle choices that can trigger it. Try to avoid or limit your consumption of refined carbs, fried foods, sugary drinks, red and processed meats, and unhealthy fats like margarine and lard. Passing on these foods can help stabilize blood sugar levels, and lower exposure to toxins. You can take steps to reduce chronic inflammation by getting plenty of high-quality sleep and moving your body every day. Eat foods known to have a high level of antioxidants, like berries, onions, green tea, olive oil, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, turmeric, dry roasted nuts, and fatty fish (eg: salmon, tuna). An overall healthy diet complemented by an active lifestyle is the best defense against chronic inflammation and the diseases it can cause. If you’re really serious about a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods, you may want to consider giving the Mediterranean diet a try. Was this article helpful?

Helps with weight loss Research has not confirmed that following a Mediterranean diet will cause a person to lose weigh. However, studies have suggested it may be a good long-term option for people seeking to manage their weight. Data for people who followed the diet for 5 years indicated they were less likely to gain excess weight than those on other diets. Benefits include: plenty of variety means the diet is not restrictive and therefore easy to maintain high fiber levels means a person is more likely to feel satisfied for longer and less likely to snack the healthy fats are less likely to cause heart problems linked to obesity Promotes heart health The American Heart Association recommends the Mediterranean diet as an evidence-driven options for preventing cardiovascular disease and stroke. In 2021, for instance, some researchers compared the effects of the Mediterranean diet with those of a low fat diet. They concluded that the Mediterranean diet was more effective at slowing the progression of plaque buildup in the arteries. Plaque buildup is a major risk factor for heart disease. The authors of another study said the Mediterranean diet could support heart health by lowering blood pressure. Supports healthy blood sugar levels The Mediterranean diet may help stabilize blood sugar levels and protect against type 2 diabetes. Studies have suggested that it may: reduce fasting blood sugar levels improve levels of hemoglobin A1C, a marker used to measure long-term glucose levels decrease insulin resistance, which stops the body from using insulin to regulate blood sugar levels effectively Protects brain function The Mediterranean diet may benefit brain health and prevent cognitive decline as you get older. One study found a possible link between following a Mediterranean diet, improved memory, and reductions in several risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. A large review also linked the Mediterranean diet to improvements in cognitive function, memory, attention, and processing speed in healthy older adults. Frequently asked questions What exactly do you eat on a Mediterranean diet? The Mediterranean diet focuses largely on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. What are the top 10 foods on a Mediterranean diet? Examples of foods to consume on a Mediterranean diet include: chard broccoli grapes parsely olives and olive oil lentils buckwheat sunflower seeds avocado fish You can drink a low to moderate amount of red wine, in small servings and with a meal.

You should limit or avoid your intake of: red meat processed foods, including meats refined carbohydrates, such as added sugars sweetened drinks liquor and beer Are eggs eaten in a Mediterranean diet? You can eat eggs in moderation, for example, 2–4 servings weekly. Is the Mediterranean diet anti-inflammatory? In a 2018 study, researchers found that not following the Mediterranean diet, or not following it consistently, was associated with higher markers of inflammation in the blood. That’s because many of the foods included in this diet are known to be anti-inflammatory. That said, other research suggests that more study is needed to determine its impact on various types of inflammation and diseases. The bottom line There is no single Mediterranean diet, but general guidelines suggest focusing on healthy plant foods and a moderate intake of dairy products and fish or seafood. The diet does not include highly processed foods, such as candies and processed meats. The Mediterranean diet may have numerous health benefits. For instance, it may help prevent weight gain, stabilize blood sugar levels, promote heart health, and enhance brain function. One reason the Mediterranean diet can benefit your health is that it provides a balance of nutrients and is adaptable and easy to stick to.

Taking your workout routine outdoors is a great way to enjoy the summer and stay on track with your fitness goals, but it’s important to be mindful of the toll the summer sun and heat can take on your body. If outdoor exercise is your thing, here are a few tips to help keep you safe while you continue to crush your workouts this summer. 1. Wear light-coloured, moisture-wicking fabrics Light-weight, moisture-wicking clothes in bright tones are ideal when exercising in the heat. Light colours reflect the sun, so it’s not being absorbed into the material you’re wearing. And moisture-wicking fabrics actually pull the sweat away from your skin, which will keep you dry and more comfortable. 2. Split up your workouts Break your longer workouts into shorter increments throughout the day. This way you’re not spending long periods of time in excessive heat or humidity. If humidity is high, it’s best to keep your workouts to 10-15 minutes per session. 3. Timing is everything During the warmer months, the sun is strongest between 10am and 3pm. If you’re planning on exercising outdoors, try to do it outside of these hours. 4. Don’t discount the benefits of AC Heat warning alerts are not uncommon during Canadian summers. On high heat and humidity days, it’s better to be safe than sorry. Exercising in a temperature-controlled gym or in your home can be more comfortable – and is safer on extremely hot days. 5. Drink the right amount of water If you’re working out outdoors in the summer heat, be sure to drink at least two litres of water throughout the day. A general rule is to drink 500 ml of water per hour of exercise. But don’t stop there – continue to drink the same amount per hour for a few hours after you’ve exercised. 6. One sip at a time Avoid taking big gulps or chugging your water. Instead, sip away on your water throughout the day, like you would a coffee or tea. You’ll maximize the fluid absorption and keep you body hydrated longer. Try these hydration hacks to help keep you drinking throughout the day. 7. Try a water workout Take up a water sport like swimming, paddle boarding or surfing. It can help you stay cool, but also comes with plenty of sun exposure. Be sure to protect your head with a hat when you’re out of the water and reapply sunscreen every two hours or less. 8. Know your limits Listen to your body. If you feel faint, light headed, dizzy or nauseous, get out of the heat and give yourself a break. Heat stroke can occur in high temperatures, and physical exertion can make you even more susceptible. If you are experiencing one or more of these symptoms, get out of the heat and drink lots of water. If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical attention immediately. Was this article helpful?

But being a favorite means they’re often overserved—and overeaten. For something with a little more variety and a lot more flavor (trust us), we say next time you’re in need of some veg, reach for the humble eggplant. The squishy insides are perfect for soaking up all kinds of flavor, so go ahead and get saucy with one of these 21 healthy eggplant recipes. 1. Sheet-Pan Eggplant Parmesan Share on Pinterest Eggplant Parmesan is classically made by frying the eggplant, soaking it in tomato sauce, and drenching it in melted cheese. While its hard to argue with that, we do love that this recipe that lightens things up by opting for baking and breaking the eggplant into single-serve portions—making it perfect for a dinner party or removing the temptation for overconsumption (because, melted cheese… ). Serve with a simple side salad or sautéed broccolini. 2. Tomato Eggplant Zucchini Bake With Garlic and Parmesan Share on Pinterest There’s a reason eggplant and zucchini are often seated next to each other at the grocery store. They simply belong together. The slight crunch and bitterness of zucchini pairs perfectly with the squish and sweetness of eggplant, which is even more amplified with cherry tomatoes, fresh herbs, and Parmesan cheese.We love serving as a veggie side paired with flaky white fish or chicken or topping on grains (like quinoa) to keep it vegetarian. 3. Baked Eggplant Fries With Greek Tzatziki Sauce Share on Pinterest Could veggie fries be any more genius? While we love potato, opting for alternatives like asparagus, zucchini, or eggplant, mean we can eat them that much more often.With bread crumb-coated eggplant and refreshing tzatziki sauce, these Mediterranean-inspired fries are one of our favorite departures from the norm. To make them extra crunchy, opt for panko instead of classic bread crumbs. 4. Persian Eggplant Dip Share on Pinterest Hummus (or guac) may be the first dip you think of when craving something creamy and delicious, but this Persian eggplant dip will change that for good. Made with only a handful of ingredients, it’s way easier to whip up than the average hummus and is a great way to shake up the table—not to mention, your nutrient intake. Serve with warm pita, lavash, naan, or some good ol’ sliced veggies. 5. Miso Eggplant With Black Garlic Share on Pinterest The sauce on these suckers is so darn good, we could honestly eat this dish for dessert. Made by blending black garlic (which is easily found at specialty shops), miso, sake, and mirin, its thick as can be and the perfect pairing to the light, natural flavor of eggplant. For a little crunch, add sliced scallions or toasted sesame seeds. 6. Easy Mini Eggplant Pizza Share on Pinterest First comes fries, then comes pizza. Is there anything eggplant can’t transform into? This recipe is a great low-carb twist on the comforting classic and can be made in fewer than 30 minutes.Simply slice the eggplant, coat with olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with marinara sauce and the toppings, bake for five more minutes, and get your pizza feast on. 7. Eggplant Patties Share on Pinterest Veggie burger patties tend to be overly dry or just a bit too soggy—they’re never just right. Eggplant changes that. Because of the veggie’s moist nature, the ingredients in the patty hold together perfectly. We’re talking no breakage and just the right amount of ooze (thanks to melted cheese). And because there’s no egg, it’s super simple to make it vegan. Simply sub vegan cheese! 8. One-Pot Greek Eggplant and Rice Share on Pinterest We love this Big Fat Greek Dinner. Made by sautéing eggplant, tomato, onions, and garlic, and layering on rice, cheese, and spices, this dish is the perfect balance of comforting and healthy. If mizithra cheese sounds like something out of Lord of the Rings, worry not. You can sub goat cheese or feta for a similar flavor—and a much simpler shopping experience. 9. Grilled Eggplant Tacos Share on Pinterest Who needs tortillas, anyway? As much as we love chips and salsa and all things taco, this recipe nails our favorite Mexican flavors—thanks to black beans, avocado, cilantro, and shredded cheese—without going crazy on carbs. And don’t worry, you don’t actually need a grill to get that charred, delicious flavor. Simply broil the eggplant or use a grill pan. 10. Eggplant Gratin With Feta Cheese Share on Pinterest We want to dive right into this eggplant gratin. Made with an unexpected blend of cheeses—feta and Gruyere—and a killer combo of creams (yes, even more creaminess than just cheese), this recipe is a decadent spin on eggplant Parmesan that’s light on tomato and heavy on melted goodness. We love the combo of thyme, chives, and basil and that the eggplant is just sturdy enough to carry its dairy-filled load. 11. Eggplant, Caramelized Onion, and Tomato Pasta Share on Pinterest While many recipes mask the flavor of eggplant with heavy sauces, this pasta recipe lets the eggplant shine. Store-bought tomato sauce is made slightly more punchy with the addition of sherry, and eggplant is accompanied by caramelized onions and herbs for a simple yet fulfilling easy weeknight night dinner. If you’re vegan (or don’t eat dairy), keep the recipe as is or feel free to top with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parm. 12. Sichuan Eggplant Stir-Fry Share on Pinterest Sticky, sweet, sour, savory… what more could you ask of a sauce? This traditional Sichuan dish does require a trip to an Asian supermarket (or specialty store), but it’s all kinds of worth it. You can also make things easier by sticking to plain soy sauce (instead of the two recommended varieties), using dry sherry instead of Shaoxing wine, and grabbing whatever dried chilis are available (just stay away from chipotle). We also love subbing crumbled tofu or ground chicken for the pork. 13. Crisp Eggplant Chips With Smoky Seasoning Share on Pinterest Yet again, eggplant prevails over potato. Now we know what you’re thinking: How can watery eggplant create crispy chips? Great question. It’s actually pretty easy! The super-thin slices mean there’s no risk of sogginess—unless the chips are over-oiled before baking. To keep that oil light and just right, opt for a spray oil (like coconut or avocado) and make sure they bake without any overlap. Sayonara, processed food. These chips are utter perfection. 14. Eggplant Rollatini Share on Pinterest These rollatini are anything but teeny. Eggplant is sliced length-wise to create the perfect sized roll-up, providing just enough space to squeeze in a hefty blend of cheeses (don’t worry, there’s delicious overflow too).For extra veg, we love adding thawed frozen spinach or diced marinated artichoke hearts. And though fresh basil does make for a beautiful topping, we actually love it sprinkled throughout the inside too. 15. Easy One-Pan Eggplant Chicken Dinner Share on Pinterest This recipe is one of those simple dishes that requires throwing things in a pot, stirring a bit, and waiting for the heat to work its magic. Easy is an understatement.We’re also huge fans of its protein-packed prowess, a hefty dose of veggies, and that it tastes good with all kinds of additions and substitutions. Don’t love chicken? Use sausage or ground turkey. Sick of spinach? Use Swiss chard or kale. 16. Brussels Sprouts Eggplant Buddha Bowl Share on Pinterest In a grain bowl rut? One of our favorite things about the easy lunch (or dinner!) is that you can throw pretty much anything in it, toss on some seasonings, and find yourself eating something super delicious.But if you do need some guidance—we all do every now and again—try this Buddha-inspired recipe full of hard-boiled eggs, roasted Brussels sprouts, and baked eggplant. As with many bowls, the secret lies in the dressing, which, in this case, is a perfect mix of tart and sweet. 17. Eggplant and Caramelized Onion Grain Salad With Walnut Vinaigrette Share on Pinterest Hate boring salads? Don’t we all. This recipe uses some of our favorite salads tricks—we’re talking grains, fresh fruit, and creamy dressing—to make it all kinds of exciting (and nutritious too).We love the crunch from grapes and walnuts and the savory flavor from caramelized onions and eggplant. But what we love most of all is the secret addition of salty feta cheese and the fact that the lettuce is warm and wilted, making it the perfect fall or winter salad remedy. 18. Crispy Eggplant “Bacon” Share on Pinterest Coconut bacon, tempeh bacon, rice paper bacon… as much as we love a good vegetarian substitute, none of the options we’ve tried nail the equally chewy and crispy consistency of our favorite bacon (as in, real bacon).Cue eggplant, the veggie that has once again swooped in to save the day. Its meaty insides mean that the texture resembles that of actual meat, and the seasoning is smoked and spiced to perfection. Whether you’re vegan or a tried-and-true bacon lover, this salty spin-off won’t disappoint. 19. Pressed Eggplant Sandwiches Share on Pinterest Perfect for a picnic, an easy lunch, or an afternoon snack (it’s a snack if you share, right?), this eggplant sandwich packs so much freshness into one bite it’s a little ridiculous. Made with pesto, grilled veggies (roasted works too), fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, and hearty ciabatta bread, it’s everything you love about Italian flavors stuffed into a single bite. Feel free to skip the meat to keep it veggie or substitute grilled chicken for a boost of protein. 20. Spicy Eggplant Balls With Minty Yogurt Wrap Share on Pinterest Lentil meatballs—and other vegetarian options, for that matter—not only take ages to make (so much boiling and blending!), but they’re also often dry and aren’t punchy enough when it comes to flavor.This recipe uses eggplant as a vegetarian filler and adds bread crumbs, garlic, onion, egg, and a slew of herbs and seasonings to make sure they’re anything but flavorless. Douse with yogurt sauce, wrap in warm pita bread, top with pomegranates, and enjoy the best Meatless Monday (or Tuesday, Wednesday… ) ever. 21. Chickpea, Tofu, and Eggplant Curry Share on Pinterest We’ve talked a lot about eggplant’s unparalleled ability to soak up sauces. But nothing demonstrates this skill quite like curry. The rich flavors sink deep into the flesh of the eggplant, making every bite a curry-filled explosion—and that’s putting it lightly.We love the crunch from onion and chickpeas, extra protein from tofu, and the fact that the curry sticks to minimal ingredients—which never happens—and minimal cook time.

That’s where 'functional fitness' comes in. What is 'functional fitness'? You may have heard of this term or perhaps even read about it on our blog before. Surprisingly, though, functional fitness is still an oft-misunderstood approach to working out. Functional fitness is the pursuit of a 'functional' body that makes the tasks you need to accomplish easier. For most of us, this means building a body that’s better at doing the things we do every day: running errands, going to work, climbing stairs, carrying groceries and so on. By using simple exercises that target multiple muscle groups and joints you can build a body better suited to help you function, reducing strain, stress and potential for injury. The exercises Now that you know a little more about functional fitness, how do you begin to work it into your exercise routines? Consider how you use your body during the average day and then work any or all of the following exercises into your routine. Squats Squats are extremely effective at targeting multiple areas of your lower body and multiple joints, particularly when you start adding additional weight by using a medicine ball or kettlebell. Sitting at your desk, bending over, and carrying weight will all take less of a toll on your body with a workout routine that includes squats. Hip openers Work in an office? You’re likely spending a ton of time sitting, and that can be really hard on your hips. From a push-up position, step forward bringing one of your legs up to where your hands are. Then, reach the same side arm towards the sky and take a deep breath before lowering your elbow as close as you can to the floor. Single-leg rows A strong back will improve how you feel overall, as everything from standing and walking to lying down is made more comfortable when your back is in good shape. Single-leg rows are a great way to build up your back. With dumbbells in either hand, bend your knees and lean forward. Extend your arms out in front of you and balance on one leg. Then proceed to pull your arms back towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together with your back flat. Russian twists Another great exercise that relies on just a single weight and your body is the Russian twist. Sit on the ground with your knees bent towards your chest and your feet lifted off the floor slightly. Hold a dumbbell, medicine ball or plate weight (or even just clasp your hands together) in front of your chest and rotate your arms and torso as one to either side before holding the position. Russian twists will do wonders for your abs, and all of the daily activities that involve your core will benefit from this exercise, including walking, sitting and standing. Turkish get ups With some of the basics addressed, you can begin to work more elaborate exercises into your routine, and Turkish get ups are one of best. Lie down on the ground and lift a kettlebell or dumbbell above you with one hand. Proceed to rise to your feet, starting one leg bent and pushing you upward, while keeping your arm straight and the weight in hand above your body. Burpees When it comes to targeting multiple groups of muscles, there are few exercises as effective as burpees, which combines a push-up, jump, and squat into one seamless movement. Functionally, the burpee targets a number of muscle groups: The push-up engages your chest (pectorals), shoulders (deltoids), and arms (triceps). The jump engages your hips (flexors), thighs (quadriceps), calves (hamstrings), and abs. The squat engages your knees, thighs (quadriceps), calves (hamstrings), lower back (erector spinae), and butt (gluteus maximums). The everyday benefits here are huge. Standing and walking, lifting objects, climbing stairs – all of these get easier by adding burpees to your routine. The benefits Functional fitness routines include some classic exercises and can be performed in the gym, at home, or even on the road with basic aides like kettle bells or medicine balls. An effective way to help build a body that will allow you to live a better life. Was this article helpful? Yes No Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

-4 signs you're suffering from burnout | The GoodLife Fitness Blog <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none;" alt="" src="https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?event=init&amp;tid=2612603590493&amp;pd[em]=<hashed_email_address>&amp;noscript=1"> GoodLife_Logo MOVE Weight Loss Workouts Group Fitness Fitness Advice FUEL Recipes Weight Loss Nutrition Meal Planning LIVE Motivation Lifestyle Mindfulness Member Stories SUBSCRIBE Press "Enter" to search × GoodLife August 25, 2022 4 signs you're suffering from burnout Tips and strategies to create better balance 4,069 views 4 min × Let’s face it - even if you love your career, work can still take a lot out of you, especially if you’re working long or busy hours. If you’re feeling more anxious and less fulfilled by your work, despite giving it your all, you may be experiencing burnout. Burnout is a specific type of work-related stress, usually when somebody has been working in one role or dealing with high levels of stress at work for an extended time. Burnout isn't an official medical condition, but rather a pattern of behaviour and symptoms that overlap with conditions like depression or anxiety. Job burnout can seriously affect your physical and mental health. Here are some signs you should look for to determine if you’re suffering from burnout, as well as some helpful tips to address it. 1. Lack of energy According to the Mayo Clinic, most people suffering from burnout report increased exhaustion. This can be a big challenge if you’re trying to stay alert and productive on the job, and exhaustion can negatively affect your home life and social relationships. If you feel tired all the time, make sure you’re getting plenty of sleep at home. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines recommend 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep every night. If you’re not getting that much-needed rest, workplace stress is going to have that much more of an effect on your health which will only increase your feelings of burnout. 2. Difficulty staying productive Along with your energy, job burnout can drain your workplace motivation as well. Those suffering from burnout often report difficulty staying on top of their projects, and may struggle to hit deadlines or fulfill their responsibilities. If you think burnout is taking a hit out of your productivity, consider speaking with your supervisor. Be open, and see if you can work together to change expectations or reach compromises and solutions. Try to set goals for what must get done and what can wait. Exercise can also be a huge benefit here. Exercise releases endorphins in your brain that help boost your motivation and can keep you going throughout the rest of the day, including at your desk. Even moderate activities like a lunchtime walk can help you stay mentally present and productive the rest of the day. 3. Physical health and wellness problems Because burnout is a stress response, sufferers often report many of the same physical symptoms as those dealing with high levels of anxiety or depression. Headaches, indigestion, bowel irregularities and body aches are some of the most common physical ailments that plague those dealing with burnout. Maintaining a consistent, healthy diet is key to offsetting the physical side-effects of burnout. Eating a balanced diet with lots of fruit, veggies and protein and ensuring your meals match your activity level will help keep your digestive system happy and should lessen the impact of stress on your GI tract. Staying hydrated is also important, as drinking plenty of water will help with the headaches and body pains. If work-related stress or burnout are taking a significant toll on your physical health, talk to your doctor right away. 4. Lack of job fulfillment and satisfaction One of the sneakier ways burnout affects a lot of people is through diminishing job satisfaction. Even when the work is being done, and being done well, burnout victims often feel apathetic or even disappointed in their work. This is part of the mental game burnout plays with your head. Focusing on mindfulness and mental wellness is important to combat burnout and find the satisfaction you deserve in your work. To practice mindfulness, focus on your breath flow and become intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling at every moment. Don’t try to process or interpret what you’re sensing. In a job setting, this could mean facing situations with patience and flexibility. Meditation is a great way to stay on your game and grounded in reality. Meditation also improves your resilience, enabling you to deal with the mental burdens stress and burnout place on you. At the end of the day, addressing burnout is about recognizing the signs, finding the causes and working through the solutions. Be open with yourself and your supervisor if you think you’re affected by job burnout, and speak to a doctor if you suspect burnout is seriously affecting your physical or mental health.

From pizza to cocktails, cranberry sauce to cranberry cake, I’ve got a range of from-scratch fresh cranberry recipes for everyone! Table of contents How to Buy Fresh Cranberries Tips For Cooking With Fresh Cranberries 20 Fresh Cranberry Recipes More Fall Recipes You’ll Love When these tiny red fruits start popping up in the market in October they are a sign that Fall and the holidays are here. They’re just so festive! Plus, of course, they are super healthy also. So I have collected links for some of my favorite healthy cranberry recipes to share with you. We have them in bread, bars and even on flatbread! Thank you to all of the other bloggers who contributed these amazing good-for-you cranberry ideas. How to Buy Fresh Cranberries You can find cranberries fresh, frozen, or dried. For the following recipes, you can use either fresh or frozen. I have a whole host of dried cranberry recipes, but for this roundup I wanted to make a useful resource for you to enjoy fresh cranberries while they’re in season. Produce Department: At the market, especially in natural food stores or Whole Foods, you can find fresh cranberries in bulk in the produce department, often in a big trough of water with a slotted scoop to get them out. Since cranberries float, you can just scoop them right out. I love buying them this way, and I try to find local Vermont cranberries whenever they’re in season. Other times, and most commonly, you’ll find cranberries sold in 12-ounce bags in the produce department. Freezer Section: Sometimes you can find frozen cranberries in bags. The vast majority of the time you can use frozen cranberries in place of fresh ones. Unlike frozen raspberries, they do not weep when thawed, so you have more wiggle room in making the substitutions. What to Look For: Avoid cranberries that are wrinkled or look like they are softening. These are not good and should get composted. If you’re purchasing bulk cranberries, avoid the ones that don’t look fresh. The others should be fine. How to Store Cranberries: Once you get them home, make sure they are dry and store them in the refrigerator. Tips For Cooking With Fresh Cranberries Why Cranberries Burst When Cooked: Cranberries are hollow, so when they are simmered or cooked the air inside heats up and expands, and then the cranberry bursts. If you are making a cranberry sauce (see below for my fave) you’ll want to be on the lookout for that mini berry explosion, and that’s when you know your cranberry sauce is done. Using Cranberries in Baking: For baking recipes, cranberries can be added in raw, either whole or chopped depending on the recipe. Using Frozen Cranberries: If you have frozen berries, you can use them while they are still frozen! When in doubt, check the notes of the recipe you are using. Balance Flavors: Cranberries are very tart and astringent, so when cooking with them, add contrasting flavors, such as sweet or salty to help balance them out. 20 Fresh Cranberry Recipes Cranberry Crumb Bars with Clementines These Cranberry Crumb Bars are an all time favorite baking recipe for a Christmas dessert or afternoon snack and any time around the winter holidays. Cranberry Crumb Bars with Clementines Cranberry Christmas Cake (with Sugared Cranberries) Help yourself to a slice of this sweet and tart Cranberry Cake with Almond Flour. It is made with sour cream instead of butter to give it a tender texture! Cranberry Christmas Cake (with Sugared Cranberries) Cranberry Sauce with Apples & Orange This Cranberry Sauce with Orange is one of my most beloved Thanksgiving recipes here on Healthy Seasonal Recipes.

They’re just so festive! These Cranberry Crumb Bars with Clementines are a favorite. They have a simple crust that doubles as the crumb topping with almonds. There are fresh clementines mixed into the cranberries and coconut oil and coconut flakes added as well. They were adapted from The Simple Art of EatingWell. Ingredients Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard Scale 1x2x3x Crust and Topping 1 cup sliced almonds, divided 3/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup coconut oil, softened if necessary according to package instructions 1 large egg, lightly beaten 2 tablespoons sunflower or canola oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 2 tablespoons unsweetened coconut chips Filling 5 cups cranberries, divided 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup freshly squeezed clementine juice (save the zest) 1/4 cup cornstarch 1 cup chopped peeled clementine 1 1/2 teaspoons clementine zest 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark Instructions Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Generously coat a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Make the Crust and Topping: Combine ¾ cup almonds, whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, ½ cup sugar and salt in a food processor. Pulse until the almonds are ground. Add coconut oil and pulse until completely blended in. Whisk egg, sunflower or canola oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and almond extract in a small dish until combined. Turn on processor and drizzle egg mixture through the feed tube and continue processing and then pulsing, scraping down the sides a few times until the mixture becomes crumbly. {Note: the crumbs will be loose, but if you squeeze them together with your hand it will clump together.] Reserve ½ cup of the crumb mixture and mix in a bowl with the remaining almonds. Press the remaining crumb mixture into the bottom of the prepared dish and set aside. Make the filling: Stir 3 cups cranberries, ¾ cup sugar, clementine juice and cornstarch in medium saucepan. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring often. Continue cooking, stirring constantly until very thick, about 5 minutes total. Stir in the remaining 2 cups cranberries, chopped clementine, zest and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Spread the cranberry filling over the crust. Sprinkle the reserved topping over the top. Scatter the coconut chips over the topping and transfer to the oven. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue cooking until the filling bubbles and the topping is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Cool completely before cutting. Notes Storing Tip: Store the cranberry crumb bars in an airtight container (or sealable bag) at room temp, in the refrigerator or freezer. They will stay good for up to 2 days at room temp, and up to 4 days in the fridge.

I really think that it can be converted to any dish and it will be amazingly delicious. Main course, dessert or sauce – delicious anyway! I already tried to cook Roasted Cranberry and Goat Cheese Flatbread, Cranberry Maple Apple Crumb Pie and Cranberry Bread according to your recipes. And moreover, cranberry sauce and cranberry marinade are regular guests at my dining table. This is a cool selection, keep it up. Thank you! Sarah — November 11, 2013 @ 11:46 am Reply Hi Katie – thanks for the recipes! My family are cranberry growers in MA and there aren’t any grown in VT unless it is basically in someone’s back yard. They need sand. katie — November 11, 2013 @ 12:11 pm Reply Sarah, thanks so much for stopping by. I hope you find some new recipes to use your berries in:) I didn’t know they needed sand. That is so interesting. I don’t know how they do it, but we do get local cranberries here, believe it or not. I can find them at a handful of good markets, Farmer Markets and as part of the locavore share of our CSA. The company is Vermont Cranberry Company. http://www.vermontcranberry.com/about-vermont-cranberry-company/ I wonder if they have sandy soils? Min — October 16, 2013 @ 8:03 am Reply What a great round-up, Katie! Cranberry is the superfood of the month at the hospital I’m currently interning at so it is definitely on my mind (and in my belly) lately ;). katie — October 17, 2013 @ 5:23 pm Reply Lucky you. I just saw the cover of EatingWell and what do you think is on the cover? I guess everyone is thinking about them:) Ari — October 15, 2013 @ 11:45 pm Reply I’ve been searching for them too–no where to be seen 🙁 I want to make my sauce + about a zillion other things, and I am super impatient. Great round up, Katie! katie — October 16, 2013 @ 5:53 am Reply Thanks Ari. I saw a picture on instagram of someone buying them in mass quantities, so I know they are out there:) Anne — October 15, 2013 @ 11:09 am Reply Great ideas! I always forget about cranberries until Thanksgiving. I buy a ton of them and freeze for later. katie — October 15, 2013 @ 1:33 pm Reply Anne, I just checked and I think I still have some in my freezer from last year! Thanks for coming by! Kalyn — October 15, 2013 @ 11:01 am Reply Loving this round-up, and thanks for including me! katie — October 15, 2013 @ 1:33 pm Reply Kalyn it is an honor to include your recipes! Thanks so much for your spinach salad and cranberry salsa! David — October 15, 2013 @ 7:54 am Reply Thanks so much for including me (#14)!

While the goal is to stick to the challenge for 30 days in a row, it's even more important to listen to your body. If you feel you need a break or need to skip a couple days, you can do that guilt-free and jump right back into it when you’re ready. The challenge: Follow a nutrition plan Whatever your diet preference (vegan, paleo, intuitive eating, etc.), follow it as closely as you can for 30 days straight. Allow yourself to follow the 80/20 rule. Try to eat healthy and nourishing foods 80% of the time and enjoy treats and more fun foods the remaining 20%. If you find yourself falling into a restrictive mindset, take a step back and focus on the goal - which is to fuel your body to feel its best. An all-or-nothing mindset can be harmful, make sure to take the pressure off yourself. Workout 3-5 days/week + 1 walk everyday Complete any workout of your choice 3-5 days a week for at least 20 minutes. The goal is to work up a sweat and get your body moving. Check out these workouts for some inspiration. In addition to your workout, take 1 mindful walk per day - taking time to think about nothing and enjoy the scenery. If you miss a day, don’t sweat it and just pick up where you left off. Drink 2-4 liters of water Hydration is key! You will start to notice a huge difference in your skin, energy levels and your hunger when you are sufficiently hydrated. Take progress photos Try to take progress photos once a week around the same time (preferably first thing in the morning) in the same outfit, and in the same place. You will appreciate the ability to see the difference when you look back on your month. One self-care task Perform one self-care task every day. This is totally individual and depends on what self-care means to you. Some examples include Reading Journaling Skin care Random act of kindness Meditate Listen to your favourite podcasts Print the chart below and check it off as you go!

-4 signs you're suffering from burnout | The GoodLife Fitness Blog <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none;" alt="" src="https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?event=init&amp;tid=2612603590493&amp;pd[em]=<hashed_email_address>&amp;noscript=1"> GoodLife_Logo MOVE Weight Loss Workouts Group Fitness Fitness Advice FUEL Recipes Weight Loss Nutrition Meal Planning LIVE Motivation Lifestyle Mindfulness Member Stories SUBSCRIBE Press "Enter" to search × GoodLife August 25, 2022 4 signs you're suffering from burnout Tips and strategies to create better balance 4,069 views 4 min × Let’s face it - even if you love your career, work can still take a lot out of you, especially if you’re working long or busy hours. If you’re feeling more anxious and less fulfilled by your work, despite giving it your all, you may be experiencing burnout. Burnout is a specific type of work-related stress, usually when somebody has been working in one role or dealing with high levels of stress at work for an extended time. Burnout isn't an official medical condition, but rather a pattern of behaviour and symptoms that overlap with conditions like depression or anxiety. Job burnout can seriously affect your physical and mental health. Here are some signs you should look for to determine if you’re suffering from burnout, as well as some helpful tips to address it. 1. Lack of energy According to the Mayo Clinic, most people suffering from burnout report increased exhaustion. This can be a big challenge if you’re trying to stay alert and productive on the job, and exhaustion can negatively affect your home life and social relationships. If you feel tired all the time, make sure you’re getting plenty of sleep at home. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines recommend 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep every night. If you’re not getting that much-needed rest, workplace stress is going to have that much more of an effect on your health which will only increase your feelings of burnout. 2. Difficulty staying productive Along with your energy, job burnout can drain your workplace motivation as well. Those suffering from burnout often report difficulty staying on top of their projects, and may struggle to hit deadlines or fulfill their responsibilities. If you think burnout is taking a hit out of your productivity, consider speaking with your supervisor. Be open, and see if you can work together to change expectations or reach compromises and solutions. Try to set goals for what must get done and what can wait. Exercise can also be a huge benefit here. Exercise releases endorphins in your brain that help boost your motivation and can keep you going throughout the rest of the day, including at your desk. Even moderate activities like a lunchtime walk can help you stay mentally present and productive the rest of the day. 3. Physical health and wellness problems Because burnout is a stress response, sufferers often report many of the same physical symptoms as those dealing with high levels of anxiety or depression. Headaches, indigestion, bowel irregularities and body aches are some of the most common physical ailments that plague those dealing with burnout. Maintaining a consistent, healthy diet is key to offsetting the physical side-effects of burnout. Eating a balanced diet with lots of fruit, veggies and protein and ensuring your meals match your activity level will help keep your digestive system happy and should lessen the impact of stress on your GI tract. Staying hydrated is also important, as drinking plenty of water will help with the headaches and body pains. If work-related stress or burnout are taking a significant toll on your physical health, talk to your doctor right away. 4. Lack of job fulfillment and satisfaction One of the sneakier ways burnout affects a lot of people is through diminishing job satisfaction. Even when the work is being done, and being done well, burnout victims often feel apathetic or even disappointed in their work. This is part of the mental game burnout plays with your head. Focusing on mindfulness and mental wellness is important to combat burnout and find the satisfaction you deserve in your work. To practice mindfulness, focus on your breath flow and become intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling at every moment. Don’t try to process or interpret what you’re sensing. In a job setting, this could mean facing situations with patience and flexibility. Meditation is a great way to stay on your game and grounded in reality. Meditation also improves your resilience, enabling you to deal with the mental burdens stress and burnout place on you. At the end of the day, addressing burnout is about recognizing the signs, finding the causes and working through the solutions. Be open with yourself and your supervisor if you think you’re affected by job burnout, and speak to a doctor if you suspect burnout is seriously affecting your physical or mental health.

You’ve been feasting on the bounty of summer fruits and veggies, and might be sad to see it go. Remember that early fall is a great time for fresh, nutritious produce. Why it's better to eat what's in season? Eating produce when it’s fresh and in season has important benefits to you, local farmers and the environment. It’s tastier and more nutritious. When food is picked and eaten at its peak, it holds its flavour and nutritional value. Once picked, it loses nutrient content quickly - as much as 50% or more. It’s local. When food is local, you are getting it at its peak freshness. Buying homegrown stimulates your local economy and creates jobs. It also reduces environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions and extra packaging for shipping. Food that’s harvested locally, in season and in abundance is much cheaper. Visit your local farmers market for the freshest produce. You may even consider picking your own. What’s in season? Early fall has about as much bounty as summer. Many of the fresh fruits and veg you’ve enjoyed during the summer months are still available. Artichokes, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, corn, lettuce, potatoes, radishes, tomatoes … the list goes on. Here are some additional healthy produce options that fall brings, and some recipe ideas to get you eating: Apples and crabapples (low in fat, a good source of fibre and Vitamin C). Use them in salads, with oatmeal and in smoothies. Brussels sprouts (low in saturated fat and cholesterol, a good source of riboflavin, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, a very good source of fibre, and Vitamins A, C, K, thiamin, Vitamin B6, folate, potassium and manganese). Use them cooked or raw in a variety of salads or roasted as a delicious side. Cranberries (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins E and K, and a very good source of fibre, Vitamin C and manganese). Use them in sauces and vinaigrettes, salads, breads and smoothies. Eggplant (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins B6, C, K, thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, magnesium, phosphorus and copper, and a very good source of fibre, folate, potassium and manganese). Use it in dips, grain bowls and even curries. Grapes (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a very good source of Vitamin C and Vitamin K). Use them in salads, smoothies or just as a quick and easy snack. Pears (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamin C, and a very good source of fibre). Use them in a variety of salads, with oatmeal, and as a perfect complement to pork. Pumpkins (low in saturated fat, very low in cholesterol and sodium, a good source of thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, folate, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, and a very good source of Vitamins A, C, E, riboflavin, potassium, copper and manganese). Use them in soups, stir fry or chili. You can even substitute them for pasta or fries, and eat the seeds too! September is a bountiful time for you to embrace all of the healthy and delicious produce and meal options that come with early fall. It’s also a great opportunity to optimize on nutritious eating.

Injuries in Canada: Insights from the Canadian Community Health Survey Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 82-624-X by Jean-Michel Billette and Teresa Janz Highlights An estimated 4.27 million Canadians aged 12 or older suffered an injury severe enough to limit their usual activities in 2009–2010. This represents 15% of the population, an increase from 13% in 2001. Overall, falls were the leading cause of injury. About 63% of seniors and one-half of adolescents were injured in falls, as were 35% of working-age adults. Young people aged 12 to 19 had the highest likelihood of injury. More than one-quarter (27%) of this age group suffered an injury, almost twice the proportion of adults (14%) and three times the proportion of seniors (9%). Two out of three (66%) injuries among adolescents were linked to sports. Among working-age adults (20 to 64), sports and work were related to almost half (47%) of injuries. Over half (55%) of seniors' injuries occurred while walking or doing household chores. Introduction Who is most at risk of injury? Where do injuries happen? What types of injuries do people have? What are the consequences of injuries? When are people more likely to be injured? Why do injuries occur? Summary References Introduction Injuries affect almost everyone at some point in their life. The severity can range from bumps and scrapes to those requiring medical attention or even causing death. In fact, in 2007, 15,064 people died of injury-related causes (6% of all fatalities). Of these deaths, 24% were suicides, 21% were transport-related deaths, 18% were the result of a fall, 9% were due to poisoning, and 3% were homicides. Injury is the leading cause of death for young people aged 1 to 341 and an important cause of hospitalization, impairment and disability for children, young adults and seniors2. Estimates of the economic burden to society that results from both unintentional and intentional injuries amounted to $19.8 billion in 2004 including direct health-care costs and indirect costs arising from reduced productivity due to hospitalization, disability and premature death3. This article explores injuries among Canadians aged 12 or older living in households, using the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Two years of data were combined in order to produce an average annual estimate for 2009–2010. The three age groups examined are adolescents aged 12 to 19, working-age adults aged 20 to 64, and seniors aged 65 or older, because each of these age groups has different injury experiences. The estimates in this article are based on data for the single most serious activity-limiting injury reported in the past year, so they do not reflect all injuries. Injuries causing death or institutionalization were also not included. Nevertheless, the CCHS is a unique source of data on the nature and context of injuries among Canadians. Who is most at risk of injury? An estimated 4.27 million Canadians aged 12 or older suffered an injury severe enough to limit their usual activities in 2009–2010 (Appendix 1). This represents 15% of the population in this age range, up from 13% in 2001. A closer look at the injury trends in Chart 1 reveals different patterns related to age and sex. Overall, young people aged 12 to 19 had the highest likelihood of injury (27%) – twice as high as all other age groups (13%). Adolescents have experienced an increase in injuries over the past decade, especially among girls (from 18% to 23%). Although males, in general, were more likely than females to be injured, young males (aged 12 to 19) were most at risk (30%). Likewise for females, it was the youngest age group (12 to 19) who were most likely to be injured (23%). Appendix 1 Number and percentage who sustained at least one activity–limiting injury during the past 12 months, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 Chart 1 Percentage injured in previous year by sex and age group, household population aged 12 or older, Canada, 2001 to 2010 Where do injuries happen? In Canada, 35% of injuries occurred during participation in some type of sports or exercise. Two–thirds (66%) of injuries among young people (aged 12 to 19) were related to sports. This was more than twice as high as working-age adults (29%) and about seven times higher than seniors (9%) (Chart 2 and Appendix 2). Appendix 2 Activity when the most serious injury occurred, among people who sustained at least one activity-limiting injury during the past 12 months, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 Chart 2 Type of injury, by age group, household population aged 12 or older, Canada, 2009–2010 For seniors, everyday activities like household chores (27%) and walking (28%) accounted for over half of their injuries. Not surprisingly, work injuries were highest in the population of working-age adults, accounting for about 18% of all their injuries. Other research has found that one-third of all on-the-job injuries occurred among workers in trades, transport and equipment operation4. Injuries that resulted from being a driver or passenger in a motor vehicle represented about 5% of all injuries. This estimate, however, does not take into account individuals who died or were institutionalized as a consequence of the injury. What types of injuries do people have? Sprains and strains were, by far, the most common type of injury (51%), followed by fractures and broken bones (17%) (Chart 3 and Appendix 3). For some types of injuries, there were clear differences according to age. Scrapes, bruises and blisters represent 14% of all injuries among seniors, double what was reported among those aged 12 to 64 (6%). About 26% of seniors and 21% of adolescents sustained fractures and broken bones, compared with 14% of working-age adults. Appendix 3 Type of most serious injury among people who sustained at least one activity-limiting injury during the past 12 months, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 Chart 3 Type of injury, by age group, household population aged 12 or older, Canada, 2009–2010 The most commonly injured body part among young people (aged 12 to 19) was their feet or ankles (33%). This was more than double the proportion reported by seniors (14%). A similar pattern occurred for injured wrists or hands, which accounted for 22% of injuries in adolescents compared to 14% for seniors (See Box 1 – Protective equipment use). In contrast, injuries of the upper body (e.g., shoulders, elbows and arms) accounted for 18% of injuries for seniors, compared with 11% in adolescents. Lower-back injuries were more common among working-age adults (16%) than among seniors (11%) and adolescents (5%) (Appendix 4). Although head injuries occur relatively less often, they are noteworthy because they may have serious consequences. In 2009–2010, an estimated 98,440 people, 2.4% of the population aged 12 and over, sustained a head injury. Of those, 57% (55,910) were working-age adults, 23% (22,720) were adolescents, and 20% (19,810) were seniors (Appendix 4). Appendix 4 Part of body affected by the most serious injury, among people who sustained at least one activity-limiting injury during the past 12 months, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 What are the consequences of injuries? About 2.29 million Canadians sought medical treatment within 48 hours of their injury in 2009–2010 (Appendix 5). This represents 54% of the injured population aged 12 and older, down from 64% in 2001. Just over half of these people went to a hospital emergency room, about one in six (17%) consulted their doctor, 13% went to a clinic, and 17% sought other types of treatment (e.g., physiotherapist, massage therapist or chiropractor). About 6% of those who needed treatment were admitted to the hospital overnight. Eighteen percent were still receiving follow-up care at the time of interview. This percentage ranges from 9% (adolescents) to 25% (seniors). Appendix 5 Type of treatment received, among people who sustained at least one activity-limiting injury during the past 12 months and who received treatment within 48 hours of the most serious activity-limiting injury, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 When are people more likely to be injured? The likelihood of injury changed with the season and was slightly higher in the summer, when 30% of all injuries occurred. People also reported that 25% of their most serious injuries occurred in winter, 23% in spring, and 22% in fall (Appendix 6). Injury risk varied over the course of the day. Nearly half of the injuries occurred in the afternoon (from noon to 6:00 p.m.). The second-most common time of day when people were injured varied by age group. Among seniors, nearly one third of injuries (31%) occurred in the morning from 6:00 a.m. to noon, compared with 14% for adolescents. In contrast, a different pattern emerged in the evening (from 6:00 p.m. to midnight), when 30% of adolescent injuries occurred, compared with 18% of seniors' injuries (Chart 4 and Appendix 7). Appendix 6 Season during which the most serious activity-limiting injury occurred, among people who sustained at least one activity-limiting injury during the past 12 months, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 Appendix 7 Time of day during which the most serious activity-limiting injury occurred, among people who sustained at least one activity-limiting injury during the past 12 months, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 Chart 4 Time of day when injured, by age group, household population aged 12 or older, Canada, 2009–2010 Why do injuries occur? The main causes of injuries were falls and overexertion (Chart 5). This is noteworthy since falls are the most common cause of injury hospitalizations in Canada5. While about half (50%) of injuries among adolescents resulted from a fall, this proportion was even higher among seniors (63%). Injuries that occurred during sports activities were mainly caused by falls. Sports accounted for three in five falls among adolescents. Falls in seniors, on the other hand, were more often the result of tripping or stumbling while walking or doing household chores (See Box 2 – Seniors and falls). Injuries caused by overexertion or strenuous movements were almost twice as frequent in working-age adults (27%) as in seniors (14%) and adolescents (15%) (Appendix 8). Appendix 8 Cause of the most serious injury, among people who sustained at least one activity-limiting injury during the past 12 months, population aged 12 and over, Canada, 2009–2010 Chart 5 Causes of injury, by age group, household population aged 12 or older, Canada, 2009–2010 Summary Injuries represent an important public health issue for Canadians of all ages. Most of the trends described in this article are consistent with findings from the 2001 CCHS6,7. The most important note is that the injury context is strongly related to age. For instance, adolescent males are the group injured most often, and these injuries occur mainly while participating in sports. Overexertion is an important cause of injury in the working-age population and seniors are injured most often from falls while doing household chores or walking.

If you’re feeling more anxious and less fulfilled by your work, despite giving it your all, you may be experiencing burnout. Burnout is a specific type of work-related stress, usually when somebody has been working in one role or dealing with high levels of stress at work for an extended time. Burnout isn't an official medical condition, but rather a pattern of behaviour and symptoms that overlap with conditions like depression or anxiety. Job burnout can seriously affect your physical and mental health. Here are some signs you should look for to determine if you’re suffering from burnout, as well as some helpful tips to address it. 1. Lack of energy According to the Mayo Clinic, most people suffering from burnout report increased exhaustion. This can be a big challenge if you’re trying to stay alert and productive on the job, and exhaustion can negatively affect your home life and social relationships. If you feel tired all the time, make sure you’re getting plenty of sleep at home. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines recommend 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep every night. If you’re not getting that much-needed rest, workplace stress is going to have that much more of an effect on your health which will only increase your feelings of burnout. 2. Difficulty staying productive Along with your energy, job burnout can drain your workplace motivation as well. Those suffering from burnout often report difficulty staying on top of their projects, and may struggle to hit deadlines or fulfill their responsibilities. If you think burnout is taking a hit out of your productivity, consider speaking with your supervisor. Be open, and see if you can work together to change expectations or reach compromises and solutions. Try to set goals for what must get done and what can wait. Exercise can also be a huge benefit here. Exercise releases endorphins in your brain that help boost your motivation and can keep you going throughout the rest of the day, including at your desk. Even moderate activities like a lunchtime walk can help you stay mentally present and productive the rest of the day. 3. Physical health and wellness problems Because burnout is a stress response, sufferers often report many of the same physical symptoms as those dealing with high levels of anxiety or depression. Headaches, indigestion, bowel irregularities and body aches are some of the most common physical ailments that plague those dealing with burnout. Maintaining a consistent, healthy diet is key to offsetting the physical side-effects of burnout. Eating a balanced diet with lots of fruit, veggies and protein and ensuring your meals match your activity level will help keep your digestive system happy and should lessen the impact of stress on your GI tract. Staying hydrated is also important, as drinking plenty of water will help with the headaches and body pains. If work-related stress or burnout are taking a significant toll on your physical health, talk to your doctor right away. 4. Lack of job fulfillment and satisfaction One of the sneakier ways burnout affects a lot of people is through diminishing job satisfaction. Even when the work is being done, and being done well, burnout victims often feel apathetic or even disappointed in their work. This is part of the mental game burnout plays with your head. Focusing on mindfulness and mental wellness is important to combat burnout and find the satisfaction you deserve in your work. To practice mindfulness, focus on your breath flow and become intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling at every moment. Don’t try to process or interpret what you’re sensing. In a job setting, this could mean facing situations with patience and flexibility. Meditation is a great way to stay on your game and grounded in reality. Meditation also improves your resilience, enabling you to deal with the mental burdens stress and burnout place on you. At the end of the day, addressing burnout is about recognizing the signs, finding the causes and working through the solutions. Be open with yourself and your supervisor if you think you’re affected by job burnout, and speak to a doctor if you suspect burnout is seriously affecting your physical or mental health.

If you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these technologies may still collect data for other purposes, including analytics, and you may still see ads across the Internet, but the ads will not be targeted based on information about you, and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.

You’ve been feasting on the bounty of summer fruits and veggies, and might be sad to see it go. Remember that early fall is a great time for fresh, nutritious produce. Why it's better to eat what's in season? Eating produce when it’s fresh and in season has important benefits to you, local farmers and the environment. It’s tastier and more nutritious. When food is picked and eaten at its peak, it holds its flavour and nutritional value. Once picked, it loses nutrient content quickly - as much as 50% or more. It’s local. When food is local, you are getting it at its peak freshness. Buying homegrown stimulates your local economy and creates jobs. It also reduces environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions and extra packaging for shipping. Food that’s harvested locally, in season and in abundance is much cheaper. Visit your local farmers market for the freshest produce. You may even consider picking your own. What’s in season? Early fall has about as much bounty as summer. Many of the fresh fruits and veg you’ve enjoyed during the summer months are still available. Artichokes, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, corn, lettuce, potatoes, radishes, tomatoes … the list goes on. Here are some additional healthy produce options that fall brings, and some recipe ideas to get you eating: Apples and crabapples (low in fat, a good source of fibre and Vitamin C). Use them in salads, with oatmeal and in smoothies. Brussels sprouts (low in saturated fat and cholesterol, a good source of riboflavin, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, a very good source of fibre, and Vitamins A, C, K, thiamin, Vitamin B6, folate, potassium and manganese). Use them cooked or raw in a variety of salads or roasted as a delicious side. Cranberries (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins E and K, and a very good source of fibre, Vitamin C and manganese). Use them in sauces and vinaigrettes, salads, breads and smoothies. Eggplant (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamins B6, C, K, thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, magnesium, phosphorus and copper, and a very good source of fibre, folate, potassium and manganese). Use it in dips, grain bowls and even curries. Grapes (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a very good source of Vitamin C and Vitamin K). Use them in salads, smoothies or just as a quick and easy snack. Pears (very low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, a good source of Vitamin C, and a very good source of fibre). Use them in a variety of salads, with oatmeal, and as a perfect complement to pork. Pumpkins (low in saturated fat, very low in cholesterol and sodium, a good source of thiamin, niacin, Vitamin B6, folate, iron, magnesium and phosphorus, and a very good source of Vitamins A, C, E, riboflavin, potassium, copper and manganese). Use them in soups, stir fry or chili. You can even substitute them for pasta or fries, and eat the seeds too! September is a bountiful time for you to embrace all of the healthy and delicious produce and meal options that come with early fall. It’s also a great opportunity to optimize on nutritious eating.

Get yourself a warm pair of boots that are also waterproof. Fuzzy, cozy footwear is great until the snow seeps through and hits your feet. Once your socks are wet and cold, there’s little you can do to warm back up. Wearing mittens instead of gloves can make a big difference. With mitts, your fingers stay together, generating more body heat. Whereas gloves might allow you to be more dexterous, your hands will be warmer in mittens. Invest in a good coat, ideally, one that’s long enough to cover some of your legs and not just your torso. EAT YOUR VITAMIN D Vitamin D is important year-round, but it’s more challenging to get the recommended dose when the sun is only out for a few hours a day. To get your fix of vitamin D, try eating foods like salmon, canned tuna, vitamin D-fortified milk, and egg yolks. FIND AN ACTIVITY THAT YOU CAN GET EXCITED ABOUT The cold weather will be more enjoyable if you have a hobby. Instead of waiting for the snow to melt, embrace the cold for the unique opportunities it provides. Try snowshoeing, skating, skiing or snowboarding. If you'd rather be indoors, try hitting the gym. The benefits that regular exercise has on physical health are well-known and widely discussed but there are also incredible mental health benefits that working out offers. Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress and increase positive self-esteem, mood, and energy! START YOUR DAY EARLY When it’s cold out, you’re more tempted to snooze your alarm and stay under the blankets for as long as possible. But getting an early start to your day can help improve your mood and mental clarity. Wake up early, slow down and relax. Take the extra time to enjoy your breakfast and a cup of coffee instead of scrambling to get a bite on your way out the door. Better yet, try an early morning workout to get your day started before work or school. If you find it hard to motivate yourself early in the morning, pop into a Group Fitness Class and let the pros handle it! GET SOCIAL Everything is better with friends. When all else fails, and you just want to curl up with a cup of hot chocolate and stay indoors, go for it! But before you do, call up a friend and see if they want to come binge-watch Netflix or try some new recipes. Even though it’s cold out, it’s still important to socialize and catch up with friends and family. 5 façons de combattre la déprime hivernale Parce qu’il reste encore quelques semaines avant le printemps ! Presque partout au Canada, le mois de février est le mois le plus froid de l’année. La période des fêtes est terminée, la neige persiste, et même si le printemps se pointe le nez, il nous faudra endurer encore pendant quelques semaines des matins glacés à dégivrer la voiture et à pelleter l’entrée. Nous sommes ici pour vous aider ! Voici cinq façons de combattre la déprime hivernale. HABILLEZ-VOUS BIEN CHAUDEMENT! Personne ne s’emballera pour la saison d’hiver s’il ou elle n’est pas habillé∙e pour affronter le froid, alors assurez-vous d’avoir les bons vêtements ! Procurez-vous une bonne paire de bottes chaudes qui sont aussi imperméables. Les chaussures en peluche sont douillettes et confortables jusqu’à ce que la neige et la gadoue s’infiltrent et atteignent vos pieds ! Une fois vos chaussettes mouillées et froides, il n’y a plus rien à faire pour réchauffer vos pieds. Porter des mitaines plutôt que des gants peut faire une différence importante. Dans une mitaine, vos doigts restent ensemble, se réchauffant les uns les autres. Bien que les gants vous permettent une plus grande dextérité, vos doigts, isolés, gèleront plus rapidement. Investissez dans un bon manteau, idéalement assez long pour couvrir une partie de vos jambes, pas seulement le haut du corps. PRENEZ DE LA VITAMINE D Bien qu’un apport en vitamine D soit important tout au long de l’année, obtenir la bonne quantité est un défi lorsque les heures d’ensoleillement sont plus courtes en saison froide. Pour avoir la bonne dose de vitamine D, mangez des aliments tels le saumon, le thon en conserve, le lait enrichi de vitamine D, et les jaunes d’œufs. TROUVEZ UNE ACTIVITÉ QUI VOUS EMBALLERA Les températures froides seront plus plaisantes si vous avez un passe-temps. Plutôt que d’attendre impatiemment que la neige fonde, célébrez le froid pour les possibilités qu’elle recèle. Essayez la raquette, le patin, le ski, ou même la planche à neige ! Si vous êtes davantage du type casanier, allez au gym ! Les bienfaits qu’entraine l’exercice régulier sur la santé physique sont bien connus et font l’objet de bien des discussions, mais, d’incroyables bienfaits sur la santé mentale découlent également de l’entrainement physique. D’ailleurs, il a été démontré que l’exercice aérobique contribue à réduire l’anxiété, la dépression et le stress, et à augmenter l’estime de soi, l’humeur, et l’énergie ! COMMENCEZ VOTRE JOURNÉE PLUS TÔT Quand il fait froid dehors, vous êtes davantage tenté de retarder votre réveil et de rester sous les couvertures aussi longtemps que possible. Mais débuter la journée tôt peut contribuer à améliorer votre humeur et votre clarté mentale. Réveillez-vous tôt, ralentissez, et détendez-vous. Prenez ce temps pour savourer un bon petit-déjeuner et boire un bon café plutôt que de vous précipiter à l’extérieur avec une rôtie froide, vos mitaines, et votre café à emporter dans les mains. Encore mieux, essayez un entrainement matinal pour débuter votre journée de travail ou d’études. Si la motivation ne vous vient pas facilement si tôt le matin, joignez-vous à un cours de groupe et laissez un pro s’en occuper ! SOCIALISEZ Tout est toujours mieux quand on est en bonne compagnie. Quand tout a échoué, et que tout ce dont vous rêvez est de vous installer confortablement avec une tasse de chocolat chaud dans votre fauteuil préféré, faites-le ! Mais avant, appelez et invitez un∙e ami∙e pour écouter une série Netflix en rafale, ou pour essayer de nouvelles recettes. Même s’il fait froid dehors, il n’en demeure pas moins qu’il est important de socialiser et de prendre du temps avec des amis et la famille. Was this article helpful?

-4 signs you're suffering from burnout | The GoodLife Fitness Blog <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none;" alt="" src="https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?event=init&amp;tid=2612603590493&amp;pd[em]=<hashed_email_address>&amp;noscript=1"> GoodLife_Logo MOVE Weight Loss Workouts Group Fitness Fitness Advice FUEL Recipes Weight Loss Nutrition Meal Planning LIVE Motivation Lifestyle Mindfulness Member Stories SUBSCRIBE Press "Enter" to search × GoodLife August 25, 2022 4 signs you're suffering from burnout Tips and strategies to create better balance 4,069 views 4 min × Let’s face it - even if you love your career, work can still take a lot out of you, especially if you’re working long or busy hours. If you’re feeling more anxious and less fulfilled by your work, despite giving it your all, you may be experiencing burnout. Burnout is a specific type of work-related stress, usually when somebody has been working in one role or dealing with high levels of stress at work for an extended time. Burnout isn't an official medical condition, but rather a pattern of behaviour and symptoms that overlap with conditions like depression or anxiety. Job burnout can seriously affect your physical and mental health. Here are some signs you should look for to determine if you’re suffering from burnout, as well as some helpful tips to address it. 1. Lack of energy According to the Mayo Clinic, most people suffering from burnout report increased exhaustion. This can be a big challenge if you’re trying to stay alert and productive on the job, and exhaustion can negatively affect your home life and social relationships. If you feel tired all the time, make sure you’re getting plenty of sleep at home. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines recommend 7 to 9 hours of good-quality sleep every night. If you’re not getting that much-needed rest, workplace stress is going to have that much more of an effect on your health which will only increase your feelings of burnout. 2. Difficulty staying productive Along with your energy, job burnout can drain your workplace motivation as well. Those suffering from burnout often report difficulty staying on top of their projects, and may struggle to hit deadlines or fulfill their responsibilities. If you think burnout is taking a hit out of your productivity, consider speaking with your supervisor. Be open, and see if you can work together to change expectations or reach compromises and solutions. Try to set goals for what must get done and what can wait. Exercise can also be a huge benefit here. Exercise releases endorphins in your brain that help boost your motivation and can keep you going throughout the rest of the day, including at your desk. Even moderate activities like a lunchtime walk can help you stay mentally present and productive the rest of the day. 3. Physical health and wellness problems Because burnout is a stress response, sufferers often report many of the same physical symptoms as those dealing with high levels of anxiety or depression. Headaches, indigestion, bowel irregularities and body aches are some of the most common physical ailments that plague those dealing with burnout. Maintaining a consistent, healthy diet is key to offsetting the physical side-effects of burnout. Eating a balanced diet with lots of fruit, veggies and protein and ensuring your meals match your activity level will help keep your digestive system happy and should lessen the impact of stress on your GI tract. Staying hydrated is also important, as drinking plenty of water will help with the headaches and body pains. If work-related stress or burnout are taking a significant toll on your physical health, talk to your doctor right away. 4. Lack of job fulfillment and satisfaction One of the sneakier ways burnout affects a lot of people is through diminishing job satisfaction. Even when the work is being done, and being done well, burnout victims often feel apathetic or even disappointed in their work. This is part of the mental game burnout plays with your head. Focusing on mindfulness and mental wellness is important to combat burnout and find the satisfaction you deserve in your work. To practice mindfulness, focus on your breath flow and become intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling at every moment. Don’t try to process or interpret what you’re sensing. In a job setting, this could mean facing situations with patience and flexibility. Meditation is a great way to stay on your game and grounded in reality. Meditation also improves your resilience, enabling you to deal with the mental burdens stress and burnout place on you. At the end of the day, addressing burnout is about recognizing the signs, finding the causes and working through the solutions. Be open with yourself and your supervisor if you think you’re affected by job burnout, and speak to a doctor if you suspect burnout is seriously affecting your physical or mental health.
