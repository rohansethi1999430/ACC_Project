You can get in a great glute workout with only a single band. Try our Glute activation warmup and see for yourself. Banded hip thrust (2 to 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps) Lie on your back with the bottom of your feet flat on the ground Your shins should be perpendicular to the floor and your knees pointed to the ceiling Wrap the resistance band around the front of your hips, and loop the ends under your feet In a slow and controlled manner, raise your hips upward until you are fully extended Push through the heels of your feet and focus on your glutes contracting to drive the motion Slowly lower your hips and return to the starting position for one repetition Donkey kick (2 to 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps per side) Begin on all fours, with your hands stacked directly under shoulders, knees under your hips, and your back flat Tuck your chin slightly and engage your lower abdominals by pulling your belly button towards your spine Keeping the 90-degree bend in your right knee, slowly lift your leg straight back and up toward the ceiling Don’t over arch your back or allow your hips to rotate Return to the starting position and repeat on the left leg Banded abductor (3 sets of 10 to 12 reps) Begin standing sideways against a wall with your right hand bracing yourself Pull the band just above your knees Keep your head up and your back straight In a controlled motion drive the left leg outward as far as you can and pause at the end of the movement Slowly bring the left leg back down to the starting position When you’ve completed your repetitions with the left leg, turn around and place your left hand on the wall and repeat the exercise using your right leg Fire hydrant (3 sets of 10 to 12 reps) Begin on your hands and knees Position your shoulders above your hands and your hips above your knees Tighten your core and look downward Lift your left leg away from your body at a 45-degree angle During this movement, be sure to keep your knee bent so that your leg forms a 90-degree angle Lower your leg to starting position Repeat this movement with the opposite leg Was this article helpful?
