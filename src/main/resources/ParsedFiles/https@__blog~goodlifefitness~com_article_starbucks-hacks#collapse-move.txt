Few people can resist the caffeinated goodness, plus it offers what seems like endless delicious beverage options. If ‘treat yo self’ is your motto you’ve probably made a trip to the 'bucks here and there. Although delicious, ordering a frap with extra whipped cream and some chocolate drizzle isn’t the healthiest option. Calories and sugar content can really add up, and it’s important to try not to drink your calories. Here are some hacks to make your next trip to Starbucks a little healthier… but still delicious: Order a smaller size If you order a smaller size, you’re saving calories while still getting your Starbucks fix. While it might not seem like a lot to take a 20-ounce Venti order down to a 16-ounce Grande, you’re getting less of everything — calories, fat, and sugar. Choose your milk wisely Starbucks offers a variety of milks – including almond milk, soy milk and coconut milk. Different types of milk have different benefits, calorie contents, etc. Check out this chart for a breakdown of different options. Typically, when you order a drink that contains milk, Starbucks uses 2 percent, unless you specify otherwise. So if you want your drink made dairy-free, with whole milk, with non-fat milk or something else, make sure you say so! Skip the whipped cream Added toppings mean added calories. Whipped cream can add at least 50 calories to your drink. For example, a Grande nonfat Caffè Mocha can go from 290 calories to 360 when whipped cream is added. If you’re adding whipped topping, you can also expect to consume a lot more fat (15g versus the 8g with no whipped cream) as well. Order light or skinny Starbucks also offers ‘skinny’ or ‘light’ options. Skinny options are made with nonfat milk, sugar-free syrup and no whipped cream. Light drinks usually come with nonfat milk, light syrup, and ice for fewer calories. Opt for unsweetened If you want to make a healthy change, avoid the sweeteners altogether. Syrups skyrocket sugar and calorie content. Consuming these sweet syrups also can trigger sweets cravings, causing you to eat/drink even more sugar! Get back to basics When in doubt, go back to the basics – coffee, tea, espresso and cappuccino are the best options when treating yourself to a caffeinated beverage. If you’re trying to make your caffeine fix a little bit healthier, just say no to the high-in-calories, high-in-sugar Frappuccino. Was this article helpful?
