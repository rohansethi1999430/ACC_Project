Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, knife, cutting board, pot, strainer, sauté pan and tongs Instructions Boil the pasta according to package instructions, drain and set aside. Place a sauté pan over medium-high heat and allow it to get hot. Add the olive oil and garlic and sauté until the garlic is golden (approximately 5 minutes). Add the crushed tomatoes and basil, season liberally with salt and pepper to taste and let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Add all of the seafood and let it slowly poach in the sauce, turn the heat down to medium. After 10 minutes, add the cooked pasta and stir well to combine. Allow everything to simmer for 2 to 3 minutes so the pasta can absorb the sauce. Plate, serve and enjoy!
