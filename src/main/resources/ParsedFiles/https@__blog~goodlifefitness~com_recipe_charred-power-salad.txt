Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, barbecue or grill pan, knife, cutting board, mixing bowls and tongs Instructions Preheat the barbecue or grill pan to high heat. Wash the vegetables and cut them into long spears (so they don't fall through the grates on the barbecue). Drizzle the veggies with avocado oil and season them with sea salt and pepper to taste. Grill the veggies on one side until they become slightly charred. Turn once and grill the other side quickly to preserve some crunch in the vegetables (about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on size of vegetables and power of grill). Remove the charred vegetables from the barbecue, chop them into bite-size pieces and set aside. Crumble the goat cheese and have it standing by. Rip the pea shoots into thirds by hand and set them aside as well. To make the vinaigrette, combine the juice of the grilled lemon, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, minced ginger, chili flakes, xylitol sweetener, apple cider vinegar, olive oil and sea salt and pepper to taste in a small bowl. Whisk vigorously to incorporate all ingredients into a creamy emulsified dressing. Place the arugula on a platter and top with the chopped and charred vegetables. Drizzle the dressing all over and finish with the crumbled goat cheese and the fresh pea shoots. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?
