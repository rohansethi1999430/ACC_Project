Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, pot, sauté pan, knife and a cutting board Instructions Boil the ramen noodles as per package instructions and set aside. Soft boil your eggs (approximately 3 minutes) and set aside as well. Dice the chicken breast and place it in a bowl with one tablespoon of soy sauce and one green onion sliced. Sauté the chicken until cooked. Add the stock to a pot and add the onions, garlic, ginger and chili flakes. Boil for 10 minutes and remove the onions, garlic and ginger from the pot. To put the ramen together do the following: in an empty bowl place 4-5 baby bok choy leaves and cover with broth. Add noodles, chicken, chopped green onions and finely sliced nori. Lastly, peel and halve the hard-boiled eggs, add them on top and sprinkle the dish with toasted sesame seeds. Serve and enjoy! Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?
