Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, knife, cutting board, skillet, metal lifter and tongs Instructions Slice the onion and bell pepper into thin strips. Heat a thick bottomed pan over medium-high heat and add the avocado oil. Add the sliced onions and peppers and season with salt and pepper to taste. Sauté for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the vegetables become slightly tender. Slice the roast beef into small strips and add to the pan. Cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, or until the beef is hot and slightly crispy. Form the mixture into two circular piles and put two slices of provolone cheese on each pile. To create steam, add a little bit of water into the pan (this will help melt the cheese). Once the cheese is melted, place 2 cups of raw baby spinach in each bowl and top with the Philly cheesesteak mixture. Serve and enjoy!
