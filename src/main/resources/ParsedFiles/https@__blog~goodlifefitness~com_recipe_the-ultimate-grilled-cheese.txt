This will help to get the bread crispier and cook faster. Equipment Needed Measuring cups and spoons, knife, cutting board, grill pan, spatula and a brush. Instructions Brush each piece of bread with melted ghee. Over medium-high heat, place one piece of bread (ghee side down) in a grill pan. Layer the cheese, chicken, arugula, more cheese and the remaining slice of bread (ghee side facing up). Cook on each side for 3 to 5 minutes or until toasted and the cheese is melted.
