Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low, cover with lid, and cook for 15 minutes. When done, remove lid, fluff with a fork and let cool. Beets: Place washed beets in the centre of some aluminum foil, and wrap them up quite tightly. Place package in a preheated 350° oven for 60-90 minutes depending on size. Beets should be soft enough to poke with a knife when cooked. When done, let cool slightly, then trim off the top and bottom of each beet, then the skin should slide right off. Cut each peeled beet into 8 pieces and transfer to a bowl. Roasted garlic: Lay out another piece of aluminum foil, trim the bottom 1 cm off of a bulb of garlic, and then place on foil cut side up. Sprinkle with sea salt, and drizzle with 1/4 teaspoon avocado oil. Wrap up tightly and place into a preheated 350° oven for 45 minutes. When done, remove from oven, and squeeze garlic bulb to remove roasted garlic cloves. Broccoli and peppers: Chop peppers into large chunks and transfer to a bowl. Chop jalapeño into a small dice, and add to the same bowl. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon avocado oil, and season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly, then transfer to one side of a parchment-lined baking sheet. Next chop the broccoli into small florettes and place into a bowl. Drizzle with the other tablespoon of avocado oil, and season with sea salt and pepper. Mix well, then transfer to the other side of the parchment lined baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350° for 15 to 20 minutes or until broccoli is cooked to the level you want it. Roasted garlic tahini dressing: Place all dressing ingredients into a small blender and purée until smooth, transfer to a squeeze bottle. Put it all together: Divide the cooked quinoa into 3 containers. Add 1/3 of the cooked and chopped beets, 1/3 of the roasted peppers and 1/3 of the roasted broccoli to each container. Top each portion with approx. 2 tbsp of the dressing and 1/3 of the micro greens. Recipe will last 4-5 days in the fridge. Rate this recipe! Was this article helpful?
