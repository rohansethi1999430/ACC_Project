We took the opportunity to highlight the new partner campaign ‚Äì Get That Feel-Good Feeling. The new campaign was a collaborative effort with our Commercial Strategy & Creative Group. We found a meaningful way to connect fitness, sport, and positive mental health. Whether it‚Äôs through physical fitness or through the comradery of sports‚Ä¶ this is a reminder to our fans to embrace every positive experience and to pursue mental health and happiness every day. We leveraged the Get That Feel-Good Feeling partner creative throughout an impactful photo booth experience on the concourse, signage in-arena and OOH, fan cam in-game feature on the jumbotron and trial pass exit sampling. It was amazing to see 50 of the GoodLife team in the arena to celebrate year 2 of the partnership. Grateful and proud to be a part of this one!
