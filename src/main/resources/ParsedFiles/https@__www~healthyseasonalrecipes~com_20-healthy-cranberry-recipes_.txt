From pizza to cocktails, cranberry sauce to cranberry cake, I’ve got a range of from-scratch fresh cranberry recipes for everyone! Table of contents How to Buy Fresh Cranberries Tips For Cooking With Fresh Cranberries 20 Fresh Cranberry Recipes More Fall Recipes You’ll Love When these tiny red fruits start popping up in the market in October they are a sign that Fall and the holidays are here. They’re just so festive! Plus, of course, they are super healthy also. So I have collected links for some of my favorite healthy cranberry recipes to share with you. We have them in bread, bars and even on flatbread! Thank you to all of the other bloggers who contributed these amazing good-for-you cranberry ideas. How to Buy Fresh Cranberries You can find cranberries fresh, frozen, or dried. For the following recipes, you can use either fresh or frozen. I have a whole host of dried cranberry recipes, but for this roundup I wanted to make a useful resource for you to enjoy fresh cranberries while they’re in season. Produce Department: At the market, especially in natural food stores or Whole Foods, you can find fresh cranberries in bulk in the produce department, often in a big trough of water with a slotted scoop to get them out. Since cranberries float, you can just scoop them right out. I love buying them this way, and I try to find local Vermont cranberries whenever they’re in season. Other times, and most commonly, you’ll find cranberries sold in 12-ounce bags in the produce department. Freezer Section: Sometimes you can find frozen cranberries in bags. The vast majority of the time you can use frozen cranberries in place of fresh ones. Unlike frozen raspberries, they do not weep when thawed, so you have more wiggle room in making the substitutions. What to Look For: Avoid cranberries that are wrinkled or look like they are softening. These are not good and should get composted. If you’re purchasing bulk cranberries, avoid the ones that don’t look fresh. The others should be fine. How to Store Cranberries: Once you get them home, make sure they are dry and store them in the refrigerator. Tips For Cooking With Fresh Cranberries Why Cranberries Burst When Cooked: Cranberries are hollow, so when they are simmered or cooked the air inside heats up and expands, and then the cranberry bursts. If you are making a cranberry sauce (see below for my fave) you’ll want to be on the lookout for that mini berry explosion, and that’s when you know your cranberry sauce is done. Using Cranberries in Baking: For baking recipes, cranberries can be added in raw, either whole or chopped depending on the recipe. Using Frozen Cranberries: If you have frozen berries, you can use them while they are still frozen! When in doubt, check the notes of the recipe you are using. Balance Flavors: Cranberries are very tart and astringent, so when cooking with them, add contrasting flavors, such as sweet or salty to help balance them out. 20 Fresh Cranberry Recipes Cranberry Crumb Bars with Clementines These Cranberry Crumb Bars are an all time favorite baking recipe for a Christmas dessert or afternoon snack and any time around the winter holidays.

They’re just so festive! These Cranberry Crumb Bars with Clementines are a favorite. They have a simple crust that doubles as the crumb topping with almonds. There are fresh clementines mixed into the cranberries and coconut oil and coconut flakes added as well. They were adapted from The Simple Art of EatingWell. Ingredients Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard Scale 1x2x3x Crust and Topping 1 cup sliced almonds, divided 3/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup coconut oil, softened if necessary according to package instructions 1 large egg, lightly beaten 2 tablespoons sunflower or canola oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon almond extract 2 tablespoons unsweetened coconut chips Filling 5 cups cranberries, divided 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup freshly squeezed clementine juice (save the zest) 1/4 cup cornstarch 1 cup chopped peeled clementine 1 1/2 teaspoons clementine zest 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark Instructions Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Generously coat a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Make the Crust and Topping: Combine ¾ cup almonds, whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, ½ cup sugar and salt in a food processor. Pulse until the almonds are ground. Add coconut oil and pulse until completely blended in. Whisk egg, sunflower or canola oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and almond extract in a small dish until combined. Turn on processor and drizzle egg mixture through the feed tube and continue processing and then pulsing, scraping down the sides a few times until the mixture becomes crumbly. {Note: the crumbs will be loose, but if you squeeze them together with your hand it will clump together.] Reserve ½ cup of the crumb mixture and mix in a bowl with the remaining almonds. Press the remaining crumb mixture into the bottom of the prepared dish and set aside. Make the filling: Stir 3 cups cranberries, ¾ cup sugar, clementine juice and cornstarch in medium saucepan. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring often. Continue cooking, stirring constantly until very thick, about 5 minutes total. Stir in the remaining 2 cups cranberries, chopped clementine, zest and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Spread the cranberry filling over the crust. Sprinkle the reserved topping over the top. Scatter the coconut chips over the topping and transfer to the oven. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue cooking until the filling bubbles and the topping is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Cool completely before cutting. Notes Storing Tip: Store the cranberry crumb bars in an airtight container (or sealable bag) at room temp, in the refrigerator or freezer. They will stay good for up to 2 days at room temp, and up to 4 days in the fridge.

I really think that it can be converted to any dish and it will be amazingly delicious. Main course, dessert or sauce – delicious anyway! I already tried to cook Roasted Cranberry and Goat Cheese Flatbread, Cranberry Maple Apple Crumb Pie and Cranberry Bread according to your recipes. And moreover, cranberry sauce and cranberry marinade are regular guests at my dining table. This is a cool selection, keep it up. Thank you! Sarah — November 11, 2013 @ 11:46 am Reply Hi Katie – thanks for the recipes! My family are cranberry growers in MA and there aren’t any grown in VT unless it is basically in someone’s back yard. They need sand. katie — November 11, 2013 @ 12:11 pm Reply Sarah, thanks so much for stopping by. I hope you find some new recipes to use your berries in:) I didn’t know they needed sand. That is so interesting. I don’t know how they do it, but we do get local cranberries here, believe it or not. I can find them at a handful of good markets, Farmer Markets and as part of the locavore share of our CSA. The company is Vermont Cranberry Company. http://www.vermontcranberry.com/about-vermont-cranberry-company/ I wonder if they have sandy soils? Min — October 16, 2013 @ 8:03 am Reply What a great round-up, Katie! Cranberry is the superfood of the month at the hospital I’m currently interning at so it is definitely on my mind (and in my belly) lately ;). katie — October 17, 2013 @ 5:23 pm Reply Lucky you. I just saw the cover of EatingWell and what do you think is on the cover? I guess everyone is thinking about them:) Ari — October 15, 2013 @ 11:45 pm Reply I’ve been searching for them too–no where to be seen 🙁 I want to make my sauce + about a zillion other things, and I am super impatient. Great round up, Katie! katie — October 16, 2013 @ 5:53 am Reply Thanks Ari. I saw a picture on instagram of someone buying them in mass quantities, so I know they are out there:) Anne — October 15, 2013 @ 11:09 am Reply Great ideas! I always forget about cranberries until Thanksgiving. I buy a ton of them and freeze for later. katie — October 15, 2013 @ 1:33 pm Reply Anne, I just checked and I think I still have some in my freezer from last year! Thanks for coming by! Kalyn — October 15, 2013 @ 11:01 am Reply Loving this round-up, and thanks for including me! katie — October 15, 2013 @ 1:33 pm Reply Kalyn it is an honor to include your recipes!
